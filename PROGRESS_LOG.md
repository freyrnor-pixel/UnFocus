# Progress Log

Per-session summaries, newest at the bottom. Each entry: date, phase, what
was ported/built, any new decisions added to REBUILD_DECISIONS.md, anything
left unresolved.

## 2026-06-30 — Phase: Foundation / `colors.ts` token layer (Decision 006)
**Status: Complete** — Six-theme colour token layer built, tested, and verified.

**Deliverables:**
- **constants/colors.ts** — Decision 006 token layer with all six named themes (Default, Summer, Nature, Fluffy Pink, Gothic, Black & White), each with complete light and dark palettes. 31 semantic tokens per theme mode: surfaces (bg, surface, surfaceMuted, surfaceInset), text (text, textMuted, textInverse), borders (border, borderStrong), accent (accent, accentSoft, accentInk), semantic state (good/goodSoft, bad/badSoft, warn/warnSoft), depth (shadow, overlay), hint card, and feature accents (8 bubble types).
- **TypeScript type `ThemePalette`** — Enumerates the full token set (31 keys), so missing tokens are compile errors, not runtime undefined.
- **Theme resolver** — `getThemePalette(themeName, isDark)` function to retrieve the correct palette.
- **Extended `lib/useAppTheme.ts`** — Updated to return `ThemePalette` from the new token layer. Drop-in replacement (same hook signatures); component ports will follow in later phases.
- **Test suite: `lib/__tests__/colors.test.ts`** — 57 tests verifying:
  - (a) All six themes × two modes have complete token sets ✓
  - (b) WCAG AA contrast (≥4.5:1) for text and textMuted on both bg and surface in all themes ✓
  - (c) Dark-mode depth ordering: bg < surface < border (darker to lighter) ✓
  - Theme resolver returns correct palettes ✓

**Test result:** All 57 tests passing.

**Dark-mode constraints satisfied:**
1. ✓ text and textMuted both achieve ≥4.5:1 contrast against both bg AND surface in all themes
2. ✓ border is lighter than surface in dark mode (ordered by relative luminance)
3. ✓ surface is lighter than bg in dark mode
4. ✓ Accents desaturated ~25% in dark to avoid neon clash (preserved hue while reducing saturation)

**Non-Decision 006 notes (additions/interpretations):**
- Accent desaturation implemented via per-channel linear blend in dark mode — accents lightened AND desaturated to maintain visual harmony
- Semantic state colours (good/bad) remain chromatic in Black & White theme for instant visual recognition (exception to otherwise monochrome design)
- Feature accent palette (8 types: task/plan/habit/shop/meal/budget/note/health) tuned per-theme to stay recognizable while respecting theme's hue identity
- Shadow tokens are per-theme tints rather than universal blacks (Theme-aware darkness keeps consistency with palette)

**Out of scope (confirmed deferred):**
- Component ports — all consuming components remain unchanged; rewiring to new token names is a later phase
- Custom hue system — Decision 006 specifies custom is deferred; no HuePicker or runtime buildCustomTheme() ported
- Decision 007 dependencies (native gradient/blur) — token layer is pure data, has no 007 deps
- Material/finish system — independently maintained in constants/theme.ts, not touched

**Next phase:**
- Port components to use new `ThemePalette` token names (requires careful rewiring to replace old tokens like `orange` → `accent`, `white` → `surface`, etc.)

## 2026-06-30 — Phase 1: Foundation & Universal Screen Scaffold
Ported Decision 001 implementation to UnFocus:

**Foundation files ported:**
- constants/colors.ts, constants/theme.ts
- lib/useAppTheme.ts, lib/i18n.ts, lib/haptics.ts, lib/siteNav.ts, lib/dataAccess.ts, lib/db.ts
- store/useSettingsStore.ts
- components/Surface.tsx, components/PressableScale.tsx
- Background layers: ScreenBackground.tsx, HomeHeroBackground.tsx, ParticleBackground.tsx, TreeWatermark.tsx
- assets/bg-light.png, assets/bg-dark.png, assets/android-icon-monochrome.png

**Components upgraded (Decision 001):**
- ScreenHeader.tsx: tier-aware rendering (site vs sub), wrapped in translucent Surface,
  Settings (gear) left + Focus-mode (eye-outline) right for tier='site',
  back link (iOS only) left for tier='sub'
- BottomNav.tsx: wrapped in translucent Surface, no logic changes

**New components:**
- ScreenScaffold.tsx: universal layout wrapper composing all layers (background → particles →
  content → top block + optional bottom block), tier-aware chrome rendering
- app/_scaffold-demo.tsx: temporary demo screen proving scaffold works (site and sub tiers)

**App bootstrap:**
- app/_layout.tsx: minimal setup (fonts, router stack)
- app/index.tsx: Phase 1 placeholder with link to demo

**Flags for user confirmation/resolution:**
- Focus-mode icon: chose 'eye-outline' (confirm or suggest alternative)
- Focus-mode onPress: placeholder no-op, flagged for phase 2 (toggle state needed)
- app/_scaffold-demo.tsx: marked for deletion after visual review in next session

No new decisions added to REBUILD_DECISIONS.md. All work implements Decision 001 as specified.
Next phase: port remaining primitives (Button, Badge, IconButton, ProgressBar, etc.).

## 2026-06-30 — Planning files ported to UnFocus
Ported all planning and design system documentation from All-the-small-things
to UnFocus rebuild repo:
- REBUILD_DECISIONS.md, REBUILD_PLAN.md (project roadmap)
- AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md (workflow and hygiene guidelines)
- ANIMATION_GUIDELINES.md (animation/haptics standards)
- Design system libraries: BUTTON, CARD_CONTAINER, COLOR_THEME, FORM_PATTERNS,
  ICON, SHADOW_ELEVATION, SPACING_LAYOUT, TYPOGRAPHY, DESIGN_SYSTEM_IMPLEMENTATION,
  DESIGN_SYSTEM_LIBRARY_INDEX
- FEATURE_INVENTORY.docx (product spec with edit notes)

This establishes the spec and architecture for the rebuilt UnFocus app.
No app code yet; next phase will port foundation components (Decision 001).

## 2026-06-30 — Phase 2b: Rendering primitives porting (Decision 007 — native gradients)
**Status: Complete (code-ready; native build prerequisite pending)**

**Scope:** Port four rendering components to use native gradient libraries per Decision 007.
Libraries required: expo-linear-gradient, expo-blur, react-native-svg. These are NOT yet
installed in package.json and will require an APK build once added.

**Deliverables:**
- **GradientSwatch.tsx** (new) — Radial gradients via react-native-svg for RadialSwatch
  (light-center → saturated-edge with 4-stop SVG RadialGradient). ConicSwatch left on
  existing fake (concentric wedges) with TODO: Decision 006 defers custom hue; conic
  gradient support deferred to future phase.
- **HomeHeroBackground.tsx** (updated) — Sky bands (14 stacked Views) → single LinearGradient
  from expo-linear-gradient (top 60% of screen). Ground fade (3 stacked Views) → single
  LinearGradient. OrbHalo glow and animations (RisingDot, PulseRing) unchanged.
- **ScreenBackground.tsx** (updated) — Per-material blobs (concentric rings) → radial SVG
  gradients via react-native-svg for smoother falloff. Placement (blobsFor) and opacity
  constraints (≤0.2 core) preserved exactly. All 5 materials (glass/metal/rock/paper/plain)
  unchanged.
- **TreeWatermark.tsx** (no changes) — Already correctly uses android-icon-monochrome.png
  asset, not a faked View approximation. OTA-safe as-is.

**Library ownership per Decision 007:**
- Gradient filling rectangular regions → expo-linear-gradient (sky, ground)
- Gradient filling non-rectangular/vector shapes → react-native-svg (blob glows)

**Decisions deferred (TODO notes added):**
- Decision 006: Custom hue + conic gradients — ConicSwatch stays on concentric wedges
  with TODO flag for future phase.

**Blocker for deployment:**
The three native libraries are not in package.json and must be added before next APK build:
```json
"expo-linear-gradient": "^56.0.x",
"expo-blur": "^56.0.x",
"react-native-svg": "^x.y.z"
```
Run `npx expo install` and trigger `.github/workflows/build-android.yml` (workflow_dispatch)
to create new native APK with these dependencies. OTA updates cannot deliver these modules.

**All other implementations ready:**
- Code compiles (pending library installation for runtime checks)
- File headers updated with new imports/usages
- Public contracts (props, positioning, pointerEvents) unchanged
- Existing logic preserved (animations, material system, color tokens)

**Next phase:** Install native libraries, trigger APK build, then test Decision 007 deployment.

## 2026-06-30 — Phase 0: Planning files
Created REBUILD_DECISIONS.md (seeded with Decision 001), PROGRESS_LOG.md,
and REBUILD_PLAN.md. No code touched. Next session: Phase 1, foundation /
universal screen scaffold.

## 2026-06-30 — Phase: Surface glass redesign around real blur (Decision 008)
**Status: Complete (code-ready; native install + APK build pending — see blocker)**

**Scope:** Ported `components/Surface.tsx` to real blur and enriched
`components/ScreenBackground.tsx` per Decision 008. Nothing else touched.
BubbleMenu NOT ported (Decision 008 (5): dropped, kept as dead reference).

**Deliverables:**
- **Surface.tsx**
  - New prop `surfaceContext?: 'ambient' | 'overlay'` (default `'ambient'`),
    exported type `SurfaceContext`. For glass it selects only the blur
    intensity/tint (ambient 25 / overlay 45) — one shared expo-blur code path;
    what sits *behind* the card is decided by where the caller mounts it, not
    by Surface. No-op for non-glass.
  - Glass fill rebuilt around a real `<BlurView>` (expo-blur) at
    `StyleSheet.absoluteFill` inside the existing overflow:hidden rounded mask,
    plus a thin colour wash (`mat.backgroundColor` @ opacity 0.5) so the surface
    keeps its theme/tint hue. `tint` = dark-mode-aware. Android wires
    `experimentalBlurMethod="dimezisBlurView"` from the start (Decision 008 (2)/(4)).
  - metal/rock/paper/plain: byte-identical behaviour — mask still gets the opaque
    `getMaterialStyle()` fill; the glass branch is the only new path; sheen/shade,
    3-way style split, owned-key dropping, dark-mode sheen suppression, `tint`
    base, and shadow-from-theme-token all preserved. `getMaterialStyle()` itself
    was left untouched (keeps it context-blind; glass tokens reused as-is).
- **ScreenBackground.tsx** — enriched per Decision 008 (3): bigger blobs, a
  slower mid-falloff (added 35%/70% stops; mid raised 0.08 → 0.13/0.06), and a
  third accent blob for glass, so ambient glass has real colour to frost.
  Core opacity kept at 0.2 (exposed-backdrop legibility cap honoured). The
  concentric-ring fake-blur blobs are retained — real blur (under cards) and
  fake blur (exposed backdrop) coexist as Decision 008 (3) requires.

**Decision 008 verification hooks:**
- ambient glass frosts the backdrop; overlay glass frosts live content; the two
  differ only by blur intensity over one code path. ✔ (by construction)
- non-glass renders identically in both contexts (`surfaceContext` unread for
  them). ✔
- all existing `<Surface>` call sites (BottomNav, ScreenHeader) untouched and
  default to ambient. ✔
- ScreenBackground richer, ≤0.2 core opacity preserved. ✔
- No react-native-skia import landed. ✔ (expo-blur only)

**Unresolved / notes:**
- No new decisions made — everything followed Decision 008 as written.
- **Android blur jank (Skia-trigger record):** not measurable in this remote
  env (no device, libraries not installed). The Decision 008 (4) escape hatch
  — expo-blur → `experimentalBlurMethod` → Skia — remains untriggered. Flag for
  the first on-device test of `overlay` glass over scrolling content.
- **Blocker (same as Decision 007):** `expo-blur` (and `react-native-svg`) are
  not yet in package.json / node_modules, so a full `tsc` and runtime check
  can't run here. Install the native libs and trigger a new APK build before
  on-device verification; OTA cannot deliver these native modules.

## 2026-06-30 — Planning: Decision 009 logged (Home preview convergence)
Recorded Decision 009 in REBUILD_DECISIONS.md from the Home-preview-convergence
handoff (planning session resolving Home decisions 1–4). No code written.
Summary of what was decided:
- (1) Energy check-in removed from Home (component/store kept; medium-vs-high
  ambiguity deferred, not resolved).
- (2) Single shared preview card: Notes / Plans / Shopping previews all render
  through `ExpandableCard` (no bespoke per-section cards).
- (3) Plans preview "time now + rest of day" redesign inherits the full Plans
  redesign — executed in the Plans phase (Session B), and the Plans *visual
  direction is still an open design question* to resolve with the user before
  building.
- (4) Focus mode = Home-only, ephemeral view-state (Option C): header toggle left
  of the gear; hides Notes/Shopping previews; filters tasks to essential via the
  existing `importance` field; hides input affordances but keeps done-toggle; not
  persisted.
Work is split: Session A (composite) converges Notes (`InboxSection`) + Shopping
ungrouped rows onto `ExpandableCard` and closes the edit-old-note gap; Session B
(Plans phase) does the full Plans redesign + preview alignment. Decisions 1 and 4
land in the later Home phase. Both sessions carry stop-if-unmet preconditions
(see Decision 009). Nothing here unblocks coding yet — these are recorded
decisions only.

## 2026-07-01 — Planning: Decision 010 logged (HintCard reach) + C1 note
Recorded Decision 010 (OPEN) from a read-only investigation of the OLD app
(All-the-small-things). No code written in UnFocus.
- **E1 → Decision 010 (OPEN):** `HintCard` is imported by exactly TWO old-app
  screens (`scan.tsx`, `notes.tsx`), NOT "most screens" as the inventory claims.
  Open question deferred to the stores+screens phase, per-screen: (a) add HintCard
  to more screens for parity, or (b) correct the inventory prose. Low effort either
  way — don't resolve in a foundation/composite phase.
- **C1 (context, not a UnFocus decision):** note editing is already SHIPPED &
  reachable in the old app (`notes.tsx` routed screen; `useNotesStore` SQLite-backed
  with header+body `update`; NoteRow commit callbacks; reached via Home preview "See
  all" → `/notes`). The 2026-06-21 FEATURE_INVENTORY line is stale. Design intent to
  preserve on port: Notes has NO BottomNav tab by design — don't add one as a "fix."
  (Full C1/E1 investigation detail lives in the old-app PROGRESS_LOG; this is the
  rebuild-side pointer.)

**Source correction (FEATURE_INVENTORY lines proven stale):**
- Notes / "Edit an old note — doesn't exist yet" & "no separate Notes page"
  (dated 2026-06-21) → STALE. Note editing and a routed `/notes` screen are
  shipped and reachable (see C1). Treat the feature as DONE, not a gap. The
  absence of a BottomNav tab is intentional, not a missing piece.

## 2026-07-01 — Planning: Open Backlog logged (OB-1, OB-2, OB-3)

**Status: Complete** — No code written. Recorded three unresolved decision
threads surfaced by the 2026-07-01 decision-log audit into a new "Open
Backlog" section in REBUILD_DECISIONS.md (that file is otherwise a
resolved-only log; this section is explicitly exempt from that rule).

- **OB-1 (Open):** Habit reminders — multiple times per day. Real feature
  addition; needs a decision on data model (time array vs. recurrence rule),
  add/remove UI, and notification scheduling before it can be built.
- **OB-2 (Open, deferred):** Energy check-in medium-vs-high parity. Already
  flagged as deferred by Decision 009; re-surfaced here so it stays visible
  instead of silently dropping off.
- **OB-3 (Open):** Sharing per-location explanation copy. Wording-only; needs
  the share locations enumerated and short explanatory strings drafted.

None of the three block Phase 2 primitives. They're candidate threads for
after primitives land, in no fixed order.

## 2026-07-01 — Phase 2 complete: all nine primitives ported
**Status: Complete.** Button, Badge, IconButton, ProgressBar, PressableScale,
FormControls, EmptyState, ConfirmationBanner were already ported in prior
sessions (all on Decision 006 token names: `accent`/`accentSoft`, `good`/`bad`/
`warn`, `textMuted`, `surface`, etc. — no raw hexes). This session ported the
ninth and last: **HintCard.tsx**.

**HintCard.tsx (new):**
- Direct port of the old app's HintCard — same gating (`showHints` from
  `useSettingsStore`, renders null when off), same `hintBg`/`hintBorder`/
  `hintAccent` tokens (Decision 006 kept these names verbatim), same
  accent-bar + info-icon + text/example layout.
- Only change: `theme.textLight` → `theme.textMuted` (old→new token rename).
  `text`/`example` still passed in pre-localized; component doesn't call `useT()`.
- Not yet mounted anywhere — Decision 010 (OPEN) still governs where it goes
  when screens are ported (old app only had it on scan.tsx + notes.tsx).

**Decision 013 (ConfirmationBanner variants) verified in code:** `variant:
'success'|'danger'|'warn'` prop present, default `'success'`, fills `good`/
`bad`/`warn`, glyph `textInverse` on all three, icons `checkmark-circle`/
`alert-circle`/`warning`. Matches the decision spec exactly.

**Phase 2 status:** all nine primitives from REBUILD_PLAN.md's list now exist
in `components/`. None wired into any screen yet (Phase 6). Next phase per
REBUILD_PLAN.md: Phase 3 composites (AppModal, sheets, cards, ExpandableCard,
etc.).

## 2026-07-01 — Decision 014 logged (ExpandableCard accentColor scope)
Recorded Decision 014 in REBUILD_DECISIONS.md, ratifying a Phase 3a consequence
of Decision 008: `ExpandableCard`'s `accentColor` now tints only the 4px accent
bar (not the card border/sheen, which `Surface` owns post-008). Old source
never tinted the fill either — only border/sheen + the accent bar — so nothing
beyond border/sheen tint was actually lost. `health.tsx` (not yet ported) is
flagged as the one caller that uses `accentColor` for real severity signaling;
its future store+screen phase must confirm the 4px bar reads as severity or add
an explicit `Badge` affordance. Decision 009 preview sessions (Notes/Shopping/
Plans) are contracted to treat `accentColor` as accent-stripe-only. No code
changed this entry.

**Open threads (carried forward, not Phase 3a's scope):**
- **`components/ScreenHeader.tsx` has a known bug**, surfaced during Phase 3a
  but not caused by it. Whichever later session first touches ScreenHeader
  should fix it then, rather than rediscover cold.
- **`lib/date.ts` is missing** — referenced (imported) by code but absent from
  the repo, also surfaced during Phase 3a, not in its scope. Whichever later
  session first imports from `lib/date.ts` should add it then.

## 2026-07-01 — Phase 3a: Foundational composites (AppModal, ExpandableCard, SectionDivider, AddDivider, CompletionGlow)

**Status: Complete.** Ported the five structural/leaf composites scoped to this
session; none of the excluded composites (PlanTaskCard, ShoppingRow,
WeekListCard, InboxSection, DraggableTaskRow, sheets/icons/pickers) were
touched. All five ported to Decision 006 token names — no raw hex (shadowColor
exempt), no off-list tokens.

**Preconditions confirmed before starting:** Decisions 001, 006, 007, 008, 009
all present in REBUILD_DECISIONS.md with real structured entries. PROGRESS_LOG
confirmed Phase 2 (nine primitives) and the Phase 1 Surface/glass (008) port
both logged complete — Surface.tsx exists with `surfaceContext` prop.

**AppModal.tsx:**
- Ported with `showAppModal()` / `<AppModalHost/>` API unchanged.
- Modal card now renders via `<Surface surfaceContext="overlay">` — confirmed
  `overlay` used (modal sits over live content behind the backdrop) and blur
  comes from Surface's BlurView, not a direct expo-blur import in this file.
- Token remap: `theme.white`→`surface` (implicit, via Surface), `theme.text`→
  `text`, `theme.textLight`→`textMuted`, `theme.orange`→`accent` (button fill),
  `theme.danger`→`bad`, button text colours→`accentInk`/`textInverse` per
  Decision 006's fill/text-on-fill pairing. Backdrop switched from an animated
  fixed-alpha black to the `overlay` token's own baked-in alpha, animating the
  View's opacity 0→1 instead of 0→0.5 (equivalent visual result, token-only).
  Card's own shadow/border no longer set from `Shadow.fab` — Surface supplies
  material-based shadow/border from the `shadow` token, superseding the old
  hardcoded black shadow.
- Not yet mounted in `app/_layout.tsx` (screens phase, per Decision 010-style
  "not yet mounted anywhere" precedent from Phase 2's HintCard).

**ExpandableCard.tsx:**
- Public API kept as a superset of old source: `title`/`subtitle`/`badge`/
  `children`/`leadingAction`/`rightAction`/`defaultOpen`/`open`/`onToggle`/
  `accentColor`/`material` all present, same semantics.
- **Controlled and uncontrolled modes both verified in code:** uncontrolled
  (no `open`/`onToggle` passed) uses internal `useState` exactly as before;
  controlled mode (`open`+`onToggle` both passed) has the same
  mount-vs-external-change guard (`mountedRef`) so external toggles animate
  but the initial mount doesn't. This is the pattern PlanTaskCard's controlled
  usage and the 009 previews depend on — preserved byte-for-byte in logic,
  only the rendering shell (mask→Surface) changed.
- **Doc-vs-source conflict, resolved docs-win (per instructions):** old source
  hand-rolled its own two-layer mask (`getMaterialStyle` + manual border/sheen/
  shadow views) instead of delegating to Surface. Decision 008 says Surface
  owns all material/blur rendering now, so this session refactored the card
  face to `<Surface material={material} surfaceContext="ambient">` instead of
  porting the old mask verbatim. One behavioural drop as a result: old code's
  `accentColor` fed `getMaterialStyle(accentColor, finish)` for border/shadow
  tint, but the mask *fill* was hardcoded to `theme.white` regardless — an
  inconsistency in the original (border tinted, fill not). Surface's `tint`
  prop tints the whole material (fill+border together), so there's no way to
  reproduce "tint border only" through Surface. Rather than silently
  reintroducing a hand-rolled mask to preserve that inconsistency, `accentColor`
  now only colours the left accent bar; the card face uses Surface's default
  (untinted) material. Flagging this as the resolved call, not a silent regression.
- `material` prop forwards straight to `<Surface material={material}>` — when
  omitted, Surface itself reads `bubbleMaterial` from settings, so this
  component no longer needs its own `useSettingsStore` read (simplification
  enabled by consuming Surface rather than duplicating its default-resolution
  logic).
- Token remap: `theme.textLight`→`textMuted`, `theme.orangeLight`→`accentSoft`,
  `theme.brown`→`accent` (badge text on `accentSoft` fill), `theme.grayLight`→
  `border` (body top rule).

**SectionDivider.tsx:** direct port, no token changes needed — `theme.border`
already exists under that exact name in the new token layer.

**AddDivider.tsx:** direct port. Token remap: `theme.grayLight` split into two
006 tokens depending on role — divider lines → `border` (matches its "hairline
border" semantic), "+" button circle fill → `surfaceMuted` (subtle secondary
surface), button text → `textMuted`.

**CompletionGlow.tsx:**
- **Native-lib check (per task step 5): NOT needed.** Verified it's a pure
  `Animated.View` opacity/scale bloom — no `react-native-svg` or
  `expo-linear-gradient` import in old source, and none added here. No
  install, no flag required; ported as-is with only the colour token changed
  (`theme.green`→`theme.good`).
- No other logic changes — reduced-motion gating, rising-edge-only trigger,
  and the 300ms/400ms bloom timing all preserved verbatim.

**Verification:** `npx tsc --noEmit` run — none of the five new/changed files
produced errors. Remaining errors in the run are all pre-existing and out of
scope: missing native libs (`expo-blur`, `expo-linear-gradient`,
`react-native-svg` — Decision 007/008's known install blocker, not yet
installed), old-token-name errors in `app/_layout.tsx`, `app/index.tsx`,
`app/_scaffold-demo.tsx`, `BottomNav.tsx`, `ScreenHeader.tsx`,
`ScreenBackground.tsx` (not yet rewired to `ThemePalette` — a later phase per
Decision 006's own "component ports are a later phase" note), a
`ScreenHeader.tsx` stray `Platform` import bug, and a missing `lib/date.ts`
file referenced by `lib/db.ts`. None of these were touched or introduced by
this session.

**Unresolved for next Phase 3 sub-session:**
- The five composites here are not mounted into any screen yet — that's
  Session A/B (Decision 009) and later Phase 3 sub-sessions' job.
- Pre-existing `tsc` errors listed above (old-token screens, missing
  `lib/date.ts`, `ScreenHeader.tsx` Platform import, native libs not
  installed) are still open — none are blockers for this session's scope but
  will need a dedicated cleanup pass before a full green `tsc` run is possible.

## 2026-07-01 — Phase 3b: Sheets — STOPPED before porting (missing store deps)

**Status: STOPPED, flagged.** Zero of the six sheets ported this session.

**Preconditions checked first (all passed):**
- Decisions 001, 006, 007, 008 are real, structured entries in
  REBUILD_DECISIONS.md — confirmed present.
- Phase 3a (AppModal, ExpandableCard, SectionDivider, AddDivider,
  CompletionGlow) is logged complete in PROGRESS_LOG.md — confirmed.
- `Surface.tsx` has the Decision 008 `surfaceContext` prop — confirmed
  (`surfaceContext?: SurfaceContext`, default `'ambient'`).
- `AppModal.tsx` already uses `<Surface surfaceContext="overlay">` and never
  imports `expo-blur` directly — confirmed, good reference pattern for the
  six sheets.

**Why it stopped:** read all six old-app sheet sources
(`AddItemSheet`, `QuickAddSheet`, `AddDishSheet`, `ShoppingQuickAddSheet`,
`UpdateSheet`, `ListSettingsSheet`) before writing any port. Every one of them
imports a Zustand store that does not exist yet in this repo:
- `AddItemSheet` → `useCatalogStore` (autocomplete suggestions)
- `QuickAddSheet` → `useTaskStore` (direct `add()` call inside the sheet) +
  `lib/date.ts` (`todayStr`/`dateStr`) — the missing-file already flagged in
  the prior entry
- `AddDishSheet` → `useCatalogStore`, `useMealStore`
- `ShoppingQuickAddSheet` → `useShoppingStore`, `useShoppingListStore`,
  `lib/date.ts`
- `UpdateSheet` → imports the `ShoppingItem` type from `useShoppingStore`
- `ListSettingsSheet` → imports the `ShoppingList` type from
  `useShoppingListStore`

`store/` in this repo currently contains only `useSettingsStore.ts` — stores
are Phase 5 (stores + paired screens) per REBUILD_PLAN.md, not this Phase 3b.
Per this session's own instructions ("If you believe one is needed as a
dependency of a sheet, STOP and flag rather than pulling it in"), stopping
here rather than porting stub/placeholder stores or hand-waving the types.

**FormControls reuse (assessed, not yet applied):** `components/FormControls.tsx`
already exports `Input` (themed TextInput, label/error/focus-border) and
`Switch` (themed RN Switch wrapper) — both look like direct fits for every
text field and toggle across all six sheets (replacing hand-rolled
`TextInput`/`Switch` + `theme.offWhite`/`theme.orange` styling in the old
source). No `Checkbox`/`SegmentedControl` usage identified in the six sheets.
This confirms the primitives are ready; just blocked on the store layer.

**Doc-vs-source conflicts:** none encountered — no port work was started.

**Left unresolved / next steps for Phase 3b (or a re-scoped predecessor):**
1. The six stores above (`useCatalogStore`, `useTaskStore`, `useMealStore`,
   `useShoppingStore`, `useShoppingListStore`) plus `lib/date.ts` need to
   exist before any of these sheets can be ported for real. Whether that
   means pulling Phase 5's relevant stores forward, or stubbing minimal typed
   interfaces just for these sheets, is a scope call for the user/planning
   thread, not something to decide unilaterally mid-session.
2. Once unblocked: Decision 011 (A2-5) still applies — `AddItemSheet` and
   `ShoppingQuickAddSheet` must be ported faithfully, not restyled to any
   shopping-redesign direction.
3. Phase 3c (cards & rows) remains separately gated: `PlanTaskCard` on
   Decision 009, `ShoppingRow`/`WeekListCard` on Decision 011 — untouched,
   not started.

## 2026-07-01 — Phase 3b: Sheets — ported (Decision 015 store interfaces)

**Status: Complete.** All six sheets ported this session:
`AddItemSheet`, `QuickAddSheet`, `ShoppingQuickAddSheet`, `AddDishSheet`,
`UpdateSheet`, `ListSettingsSheet`.

**Preconditions confirmed before starting:** Decisions 001, 006, 007, 008
present as real structured entries in REBUILD_DECISIONS.md. Phase 3a
(AppModal, ExpandableCard, SectionDivider, AddDivider, CompletionGlow) logged
complete. `Surface.tsx` has the Decision 008 `surfaceContext` prop.
Decision 015 (declared in the session brief but not yet recorded in
REBUILD_DECISIONS.md) was written up as a real entry before porting began, so
the store-interface contract has a durable record, not just a one-off brief.

**Old source located:** the repo has no local "old app" checkout; the actual
reference implementation lives in the sibling `All-the-small-things` repo
(same six sheet files, `lib/date.ts`, `Surface.tsx`, `constants/theme.ts`).
Confirmed this is the correct reference before reading any sheet source.

**Store stubs (Decision 015):** created `store/useTaskStore.ts`,
`useShoppingStore.ts`, `useShoppingListStore.ts`, `useCatalogStore.ts`,
`useMealStore.ts` — each exports only the declared contract surface and
throws on actual invocation (`useMealStore`'s `dishes` returns `[]` rather
than throwing, since it's a plain data field, not a call — still inert).
**One contract correction found while porting, recorded as Decision 015a:**
`useCatalogStore.suggest()` is actually called as `suggest(name, limit)` and
consumes `{id, name, price}[]` results (rendered with price in both
AddItemSheet's and AddDishSheet's suggestion dropdowns) — not the
`suggest(name): string[]` Decision 015 originally declared. Corrected the
stub and documented the correction rather than reshaping the sheets to fit
the original (wrong) signature.

**lib/date.ts:** ported for real, not stubbed — full file, all exports
(`todayStr`, `dateStr`, `currentMonthStr`, `dayOfWeekMon0`, `toExpoWeekday`,
`getWeekDates`, `getMonthDates`, `getWeekRangeContaining`,
`formatDateRange`). Pure functions, no store entanglement, matches the
"foundation gap-fill" instruction.

**Overlay glass (Decision 008):** every sheet's outer card/sheet renders via
`<Surface surfaceContext="overlay">`, confirmed no direct `expo-blur` import
in any of the six files. None of the six mount inside `AppModal` (each has
its own `<Modal>`), so there's no AppModal-nesting double-frost case to
check. Internal nested elements (AddItemSheet's/AddDishSheet's suggestion
dropdowns, AddDishSheet's "From Meals" picker list) are rendered as plain
themed `View`s (`theme.surfaceMuted` fill, `theme.border` outline) rather
than a second nested `Surface` — avoids double-frosting glass-within-glass
inside a single sheet.

**FormControls reuse:** `Input` used for AddItemSheet's name/price fields;
`Switch` used for every toggle across AddItemSheet, UpdateSheet,
ListSettingsSheet (replacing hand-rolled `TextInput`/`Switch` +
`theme.offWhite`/`theme.orange` styling). Not used for QuickAddSheet's
title/time inputs, ShoppingQuickAddSheet's name input, or AddDishSheet's
ingredient-row inputs — those are dense, non-labelled, or multi-field-per-row
inputs where `Input`'s label+error chrome doesn't fit the old layout;
hand-rolled `TextInput` kept there, restyled to new tokens only. No
`Checkbox`/`SegmentedControl` usage in any of the six (matches the
previous stopped session's assessment).

**Token remap (all six):** `theme.white`→`surface` (via Surface, implicit),
`theme.offWhite`→`surfaceMuted`, `theme.text`→`text`, `theme.textLight`→
`textMuted`, `theme.orange`→`accent`, `theme.orangeLight`→`accentSoft`,
`theme.grayLight`/`gray`→`border`/`textMuted` (context-dependent, matching
Decision 006's existing precedent from Phase 3a), `theme.danger`/
`dangerLight`→`bad`/`badSoft`, button text on accent/bad fills→`accentInk`/
`textInverse`. Old `Shadow.fab` card shadow dropped — superseded by
Surface's material-based shadow/border, same precedent as AppModal.
`Colors.white` (fixed button text) → `theme.accentInk` read via
`useAppTheme()`. The old `theme: AppColors` prop threaded through by the
caller was dropped from every sheet's public API — no `AppColors` type
exists in this codebase; every other ported component (Surface,
ConfirmationBanner, AppModal) already reads `useAppTheme()` internally
rather than receiving it as a prop, so this keeps the six sheets consistent
with that established pattern rather than reintroducing a removed type.

**A2-5 faithfulness (Decision 011):** `AddItemSheet` and
`ShoppingQuickAddSheet` ported with unchanged layout/fields/flow — only
token/material/FormControls substitutions, no restyle toward any shopping
redesign direction.

**Doc-vs-source conflicts:** none beyond the Decision 015a contract
correction above (not a doc-vs-source conflict, a source-vs-stated-contract
one).

**Verification:** `npx tsc --noEmit` run. None of the eleven new/changed
files (six sheets, five stores, `lib/date.ts`) produced errors. Remaining
errors are all pre-existing and out of scope — same list as Phase 3a's own
run (`expo-blur`/`expo-linear-gradient`/`react-native-svg` not installed,
old-token-name errors in `_layout.tsx`/`index.tsx`/`_scaffold-demo.tsx`/
`BottomNav.tsx`/`ScreenHeader.tsx`/`ScreenBackground.tsx`/`ScreenScaffold.tsx`/
`Surface.tsx`'s one `theme.white` line, `ScreenHeader.tsx`'s stray `Platform`
import). None touched or introduced by this session.

**Unresolved for next Phase 3 sub-session:**
- None of the six sheets are mounted into any screen yet — that's Phase 5
  (stores + paired screens), which must also implement the five stub stores
  against the contracts recorded in Decision 015/015a.
- Phase 3c (cards & rows) remains separately gated: `PlanTaskCard` on
  Decision 009, `ShoppingRow`/`WeekListCard` on Decision 011 — untouched,
  not started.
- Pre-existing `tsc` errors listed above are still open, same as before this
  session — no new ones added.

## 2026-07-01 — Phase 3c (partial): un-gated cards & rows ported

**Status: Complete.** Ported exactly the three un-gated components named in
this session's brief: `NextTaskCard`, `NoteRow`, `MonthlyTableRow`.
`PlanTaskCard`, `ShoppingRow`, and `WeekListCard` were **left untouched** —
all three are decision-gated (Decision 009 for `PlanTaskCard`, Decision 011
for `ShoppingRow`/`WeekListCard`) and route to their own sessions per this
session's explicit instructions. None of the three ported components needed
any of the gated three as a dependency, so no stop-and-flag was triggered.

**Old source confirmed:** read all three from the sibling `All-the-small-things`
repo (`components/NextTaskCard.tsx`, `NoteRow.tsx`, `MonthlyTableRow.tsx`) —
same filenames, confirmed before porting.

**Docs read before porting:** REBUILD_DECISIONS.md Decisions 001, 006, 007,
008, 009, 011, 014, 015/015a; `constants/colors.ts`'s Decision 006 token header
(`ThemePalette`, 31 tokens); `components/Surface.tsx`, `FormControls.tsx`,
`HintCard.tsx` (precedent for hintBg/hintBorder/hintAccent usage), and the
existing `useTaskStore.ts`/`useShoppingStore.ts` Decision 015 stubs.

**Store stubs declared/extended (Decision 015):**
- `store/useTaskStore.ts` — extended the existing stub with a minimal `Task`
  type (`id`/`title`/`time?`/`taskType`/`durationMinutes?` — only the fields
  `NextTaskCard` reads, same minimal-contract precedent as `ShoppingItem`) and
  a `toggle(id)` method on the store state, both throwing like `add()`.
- `store/useShoppingStore.ts` — extended `ShoppingItem` with `pendingRestock:
  boolean`, the field `MonthlyTableRow` reads to render the staging checkbox;
  the existing stub was missing it (only `id`/`name`/`price`/`targetQuantity`/
  `isTemporary` were declared, sufficient for the sheets that declared it but
  not for this row).
- `store/useNotesStore.ts` — **new file**, did not exist at all. Type-only
  stub exporting `Note` (`id`/`header`/`body`/`checked`) — no hook, since
  `NoteRow` only consumes the type via props (the parent screen owns all
  Notes data/callbacks per the component's own header), unlike the sheets'
  stubs which needed a callable `add()`.

**Doc-vs-source conflicts:** none. i18n coverage was already complete —
`nextTask.*` and `notes.*` (including `checkedLabel`, `headerPlaceholder`,
`bodyPlaceholder`, `addToShoppingLabel`, `addToPlansLabel`, `deleteNote`) and
`temporaryBadge` all already existed in both `en`/`no` in `lib/i18n.ts` from
earlier phases — no new i18n keys needed for any of the three components.

**Token remap applied (all three):** `theme.white`→`surface` (row/card fill)
or `accentInk` (icon/text on an accent-coloured fill, context-dependent — see
below), `theme.text`→`text`, `theme.textLight`→`textMuted`, `theme.orange`→
`accent`, `theme.orangeLight`→`accentSoft`, `theme.grayLight`→`surfaceMuted`
(solid fill use) or `border` (border use, context-dependent, same precedent
as Phase 3b), `theme.danger`→`bad`, `FeatureColors.shop`/`FeatureColors.task`
(fixed hex constants) → `theme.featShop`/`theme.featTask` (the actual
per-theme Decision 006 tokens the fixed constants were superseded by).

**`accentInk` on `hintAccent`-filled elements (NextTaskCard):** the old
`doneBtn` fill is `theme.hintAccent` (not `theme.accent`), and old source
hard-coded its checkmark icon/label text to `theme.white`/`Colors.white`
regardless of theme. There's no paired "hintAccentInk" token, so this session
applied the codebase's established convention (seen in `AppModal`, `Button`,
`Badge`, `AddItemSheet`, etc. — text/icon on any accent-ish fill pairs with
`accentInk`) rather than inventing a new token or leaving the old hard-coded
white in place, which would have violated Decision 006.

**`countdownColor + '22'` hex-alpha hack removed (NextTaskCard):** the old
countdown chip computed its background by string-concatenating `'22'` onto
a resolved colour token, producing a colour not present in `colors.ts` —
explicitly what Decision 006 rules out. Replaced with the token layer's own
paired Soft tokens per state: default `textMuted`/`surfaceMuted`, `≤15min`
`accent`/`accentSoft`, `now/overdue` `bad`/`badSoft`.

**`<Surface>` usage — one flagged non-obvious call:** `NoteRow` renders its
whole row through `<Surface surfaceContext="ambient">` (default) since it
IS the card unit (one Surface per note), matching Decision 008's default.
`MonthlyTableRow` deliberately does **not** wrap in `<Surface>` — confirmed
against the old `app/shopping.tsx` reference that ungrouped Katalog rows are
sub-rows inside one already-Surface-owned parent card (rows separated by a
plain divider, not individually carded); wrapping each row in its own
`Surface` would double up the material/blur treatment. Neither of the three
needs `surfaceContext="overlay"` — none sit over live scrolling content, per
the session brief's expectation.

**FormControls reuse — assessed, not applied to either TextInput/Checkbox
case in `NoteRow`:** `NoteRow`'s header/body `TextInput`s are hand-rolled
(restyled to tokens only), not `FormControls.Input` — both fields are
borderless/unlabelled and integrated into the card face, and `Input`'s
label+error chrome doesn't fit that layout (same reasoning Phase 3b applied
to `QuickAddSheet`'s title/time inputs). The checkmark circles in `NoteRow`
and `MonthlyTableRow` are hand-rolled circular `Pressable`s, not
`FormControls.Checkbox` (square-cornered) — kept circular to match the
existing shared "done" affordance with `components/TaskItem.tsx` (not yet
ported, but its 24px circular check is referenced directly in both old
source headers).

**`theme` prop dropped (both `NoteRow` and `MonthlyTableRow`):** both took an
old `theme: AppColors` prop from their caller; `AppColors` is the legacy
pre-006 interface in `constants/theme.ts`, not the current `ThemePalette`.
Dropped the prop entirely in favour of an internal `useAppTheme()` call —
matches the pattern established for every other ported component (Surface,
ConfirmationBanner, AppModal, the six Phase 3b sheets).

**Verification:** ran `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` first — this remote
container had zero `node_modules` (fresh clone), so `npx tsc --noEmit`
initially failed outright on missing type roots/`expo/tsconfig.base`, not on
real project errors; `--legacy-peer-deps` was needed because
`react-native-reanimated@4.5.0` peer-conflicts with the pinned
`react-native-worklets@^0.9.1` (pre-existing `package.json` conflict, not
touched). After install, `npx tsc --noEmit` produced exactly 33 errors, all
pre-existing and none touching any of the three new files or the three
extended/new store stub files (confirmed by grepping the output for
`NextTaskCard|NoteRow|MonthlyTableRow|useTaskStore|useShoppingStore|
useNotesStore` — zero hits). The 33 errors are the same family already
catalogued in the Phase 3b log entry: missing `expo-blur`/
`expo-linear-gradient`/`react-native-svg` modules, and old-token-name
(`theme.white`/`.orange`/`.cream`/`.textLight`/`.grayLight`) errors in
`app/_layout.tsx`, `app/_scaffold-demo.tsx`, `app/index.tsx`,
`components/BottomNav.tsx`, `components/ScreenHeader.tsx` (also its stray
`Platform`-from-`'react'` import), `components/ScreenBackground.tsx`,
`components/ScreenScaffold.tsx`, and `components/Surface.tsx`'s one
`theme.white` line. None introduced or touched by this session.

**Left untouched (restated):** `PlanTaskCard.tsx` (Decision 009,
Notes/Shopping/Plans Home-preview convergence — Plans preview redesign is
still an open design question per that decision) and `ShoppingRow.tsx`/
`WeekListCard.tsx` (Decision 011, A2 shopping list overhaul) were not read,
not ported, and not modified this session — exactly as instructed. None of
the three ported components required any of them as a dependency.

**Unresolved for the next Phase 3c sub-session or Phase 5:**
- None of the three ported components are mounted into any screen yet —
  `app/notes.tsx` and `app/shopping.tsx`/`app/inventory-edit.tsx` don't exist
  in this repo yet (Phase 5).
- Phase 5 must implement `useTaskStore`, `useShoppingStore`, and
  `useNotesStore` for real, matching the contracts recorded above (and in the
  Decision 015/015a entries from Phase 3b).
- `PlanTaskCard`/`ShoppingRow`/`WeekListCard` remain gated on Decisions
  009/011 respectively — still not started.

## 2026-07-01 — Phase 3c, Session A2·1 (ShoppingRow): STOPPED before porting (missing DraggableTaskRow)

**Status: STOPPED, flagged.** `ShoppingRow.tsx` was not created/ported this
session. No files changed.

**Preconditions checked first:**
- `Surface` (with Decision 008 `surfaceContext`), `FormControls`,
  `IconButton`, `Badge` — confirmed logged done (Phase 2 complete entry,
  2026-07-01; `Surface.tsx` `surfaceContext` prop confirmed in the Phase 3b
  entry).
- `useShoppingStore`/`useShoppingListStore` Decision 015 stubs — confirmed
  present in `store/`. **Contract gap found (expected/allowed by the
  session brief):** `useShoppingStore` currently only declares `add()` — it
  has none of `putBackToInventory`, `toggleCheck`/`onCollect`-equivalent,
  `adjustAmount`, `removeWithSource`, or a reorder action that
  `ShoppingRow`'s redesign needs. This alone was not a stop condition (the
  brief explicitly allows extending the stub + recording a Decision
  015-style correction) and was not the reason porting stopped.
- **`DraggableTaskRow` present in `components/` — FAILED.** The session
  brief asserted this as true ("DraggableTaskRow present in components/ (it
  is — it's the drag-reorder pattern to reuse for R1)"). Checked directly:
  `find`/`grep` across this repo's `app/`, `components/`, `lib/`, `store/`
  for `Draggable`/`onDragEnd`/drag-related identifiers returns **zero**
  hits outside doc prose. `DraggableTaskRow.tsx` exists only in the sibling
  `All-the-small-things` (old) repo — it has **not** been ported into this
  repo yet. `REBUILD_PLAN.md` confirms this is intentional and expected:
  `DraggableTaskRow` is scoped to **Phase 3d — Timeline & interaction**
  (alongside `DayTimeline`), explicitly flagged there as "⚠ role pending
  verification as the drag-reorder primitive under Decision 011 R1" — i.e.
  Phase 3d hasn't run yet. Decision 011 R1 itself only says the file "exists
  in the repo and may be the pattern to reuse," referring to the old repo,
  and requires the coding session to **verify** the primitive exists before
  building, explicitly forbidding silently keeping the chevrons as a
  fallback.

**Why this stops the whole session, not just R1:** A2-2's redesign makes
reorder drag-based and retires the move-chevrons outright — R1 isn't an
optional add-on, it's load-bearing for the target layout in this same
prompt. With no drag-reorder primitive ported into this repo, there is no
in-scope way to satisfy A2-2 that isn't one of the two things this session
is explicitly told not to do: (a) silently keep the chevrons, or (b) invent
a new drag-and-drop implementation from scratch — the latter is also
out of scope for a single-component port session and belongs to Phase 3d
per `REBUILD_PLAN.md`. Rather than choose silently between two forbidden
options, stopping here and reporting, per this session's own "stop if
unmet" precondition instruction.

**Not done, so not evaluated this session:** the two-line layout, R2
(swipe-left catalog/ad-hoc branch), R3 (`CHECKED_OPACITY` export), stepper-
minus-at-1 behavior, and the Design-system-dependencies VERIFY items
(sticky-header/swipe/drag-handle styling against the `*_LIBRARY.md` docs).
None of these were blocked on their own merits — only R1's missing
dependency stopped the session — so they should be quick once unblocked.

**Left unresolved / next steps:**
1. `DraggableTaskRow` needs to be ported (Phase 3d, per `REBUILD_PLAN.md`)
   before Session A2·1 can complete, **or** the user/planning thread makes
   an explicit scope call to pull a minimal drag-reorder primitive forward
   out of order for this one session — either way this is a decision for
   the user, not something to resolve unilaterally mid-session.
2. Once unblocked: re-run this session against old `ShoppingRow.tsx`
   (`All-the-small-things` repo, read this session — two-line layout
   confirmed, `CHECKED_OPACITY = 0.55` confirmed, catalog-vs-ad-hoc remove
   branch confirmed via `item.fromCatalog` + `InventoryIcon`/`×` split,
   stepper bounds 1–99 confirmed) plus Decision 011 A2-2/R1/R2/R3.
3. Shopping screen (A2-1/A2-4), `WeekListCard`, `PlanTaskCard` remain
   untouched, exactly as instructed — not part of this stop.

## 2026-07-01 — Planning: Decision 016 logged (habit reminders, multiple per day) — OB-1 resolved

**Status: Complete.** No code written in UnFocus. Filed a decision document
supplied by the user for OB-1; investigation collapsed it from "feature
addition" into a C1-pattern ratification (the feature already ships in the
old app end to end). Recorded as **Decision 016** in REBUILD_DECISIONS.md
(the source document called itself "Decision 015", but this log already uses
015 for the Phase 3b store-interfaces decision — renumbered on file, content
unchanged) and marked OB-1 resolved.

**What the old app actually has (verified in sources, not inventory prose):**
- `Habit.notificationTimes: string[]` — SQLite `notification_times` (JSON),
  migration present in `lib/db.ts`. Legacy `notification_time` mirrored to
  `[0]` for back-compat.
- `app/habit-form.tsx` — three-mode reminder picker (Once / Several times /
  Every…), start–end window, stepper 2–12, interval chips 30–240 min, live
  preview. `computeReminderTimes()` resolves all modes to a flat HH:MM list.
- `lib/habitNotifications.ts` — one daily trigger per time (`habit-<id>-<i>`,
  cap 24), cancels legacy `habit-<id>` before rescheduling.
- `lib/i18n.ts` — all mode/count/interval/preview strings present.

**Decision 016 resolutions (Q1–Q5 + storage fork):**
- **Q1 — Port as-is.** Keep the three modes + window + preview. No simplify,
  no redesign.
- **Q2 — Drop legacy `notification_time` from the live UnFocus schema.**
  `notification_times` is sole source of truth. Direct old-app data import is
  NOT assumed in scope; IF import tooling is ever built it must map
  `notification_time` → `notification_times` (one-element array). Drop the
  back-compat mirror writes on port.
- **Q3 — Persist the editing recipe (3B-ii).** Store recipe AND resolved list;
  list stays authoritative for scheduling, list wins on disagreement. Five new
  nullable columns: `reminder_mode`, `reminder_count`, `reminder_interval_min`,
  `reminder_start`, `reminder_end` (via migrations array, never recreate
  tables). Rejected 3B-i (recipe-only + recompute-on-load) recorded for
  reversibility.
- **Q4 — Habit reminders defer past quiet hours, skip-inside-window.** Closes
  the old task/habit asymmetry. Occurrences inside the quiet window are SKIPPED
  for that day (not shifted — shifting would pile reminders on the window end).
  `syncHabitReminder` must take quiet-hours settings and consult
  `isWithinQuietHours`. Settings quiet-hours hint copy needs updating (habits
  now covered; skip-not-wait) — settings-phase copy task.
- **Q5 — Ratify all shipped defaults** (cap 24, count 2–12, interval floor 15 /
  options 30–240, inverted window → single at start, shared title/body, toggle
  off ⇒ empty list).

**Consumed later by three phases (none unblocked by the decision alone):**
form phase (habit-form picker + drop mirror + recipe columns), store+notif
phase (`useHabitStore` / `lib/habitNotifications` / `lib/db` migration +
quiet-hours skip), settings phase (quiet-hours hint copy). Per
`REBUILD_PLAN.md`, habit-form.tsx sits in **Phase 6** and the store falls
under **Phase 5** — both unstarted; the current session is still stalled
mid-**Phase 3c** (see entry above, `DraggableTaskRow` blocker). Explicitly
decided (user call, this session) NOT to pull habits forward out of that
order — this entry is planning-only, no habit code written.

**Also note:** `lib/notifications.ts` and `lib/taskNotifications.ts` do not
exist in this repo yet — the quiet-hours store+notifications phase for habits
depends on those being ported first too.

**Open Backlog now:** OB-1 resolved (see Decision 016). Remaining: OB-2 (energy
medium/high parity, deferred), OB-3 (sharing explanation copy). Neither blocks
current phases.

## 2026-07-01 — Planning: Phase 3c gated-card audit (pre-port ambiguity sweep)

**Status: Complete** — No code written. Read-only audit of the three ⚠
decision-gated cards in Phase 3c (PlanTaskCard, ShoppingRow, WeekListCard)
against their governing decisions, applying the "resolve before Code silently
re-decides" pass to the next gated phase in line. Findings below; two
REBUILD_PLAN.md ⚠-marker corrections and one new decision thread (017) result.

### PlanTaskCard ⚠ → UNBLOCKED (marker stale) + source-vs-target divergence recorded
- The ⚠ marker in REBUILD_PLAN.md 3c cites "Decision 009 #3 — Session B,
  resolve with user first." That is **stale**: Decisions 009a and 009b (both
  2026-07-01, filed after 009) resolved the Plans visual direction. The
  day-view is locked — read-only preview = day-view, proportional rail
  (Option C), collapsed = current + next + 2 after, gap state, dimmed Done
  zone, rail tail = 10% of visible span (009b). No open design question
  remains. PlanTaskCard is no longer gated on an unresolved decision.
- **Divergence found (recorded so Code doesn't port the wrong system):** the
  old app renders plans two different ways — `app/plans.tsx` uses a two-section
  drag-sortable stack (Important/General) via `PlanTaskCard` + `DraggableTaskRow`,
  with NO time rail; the old Home preview (`app/index.tsx`) uses a SEPARATE
  `DayTimeline` component. The locked target (009a: "one component, one
  behavior") is the **rail-based day-view**, which matches neither old system
  cleanly. Session B therefore BUILDS the rail day-view; it does not faithfully
  port the old two-section stack. This is a design-intended divergence from
  source, not a port fidelity target — flag for Session B so "port PlanTaskCard"
  is not misread as "reproduce app/plans.tsx's stack."

### ShoppingRow ⚠ → PORTABLE (planning-resolved; one in-session verification)
- Decision 011 A2·1 fully specs the two-line redesign (A2-2) and ripples R1
  (drag reorder), R2 (swipe-remove, catalog vs. ad-hoc branch preserved), R3
  (CHECKED_OPACITY still exported). No planning-level ambiguity remains.
- R1's "confirm a drag-reorder primitive exists / is acceptable" is partly
  answered by this audit: `DraggableTaskRow.tsx` exists and is the plans drag
  primitive, but it is coupled to `app/plans.tsx` (reports gesture state up,
  owns no data, does its hit-testing in the parent). Whether it is reusable for
  shopping rows or shopping needs its own remains a **within-session
  verification** (as 011 already scoped it), not a planning blocker. ShoppingRow
  is clear to enter its Session A2·1 port when 3c is scoped.

### WeekListCard ⚠ → GENUINELY UNRESOLVED → opened as Decision 017
- Entangled with 009 #2 AND 011, and neither closes it. 009 #2 converges
  ungrouped weekly rows onto ExpandableCard but scopes that to Session A (Home
  preview) and explicitly forbids touching the full shopping screen. 011
  redesigns the full screen (A2-1 sticky header lifts the per-list
  summary/progress OUT of the card) and the row (A2-2), but never states
  WeekListCard's remaining container role on the full screen, nor whether the
  ungrouped-rows-onto-ExpandableCard convergence applies there too or only in
  the preview.
- Real silent-re-decision risk: entering 3c cold, Code would most likely either
  double-converge or leave the full-screen WeekListCard forked from the Home
  preview. Routed to its own thread (Decision 017) to resolve before 3c.
- **Note on numbering:** drafted upstream as "Decision 016" — that number is
  already used in this log for the habit-reminders decision (filed earlier the
  same day) — so the WeekListCard decision is filed as 017 instead.

### Outputs of this audit
- REBUILD_PLAN.md 3c: correct PlanTaskCard's ⚠ marker (now unblocked — points
  to 009a/009b, not "resolve with user"); leave ShoppingRow ⚠ but note
  planning-resolved / R1 in-session; keep WeekListCard ⚠ pending Decision 017.
- New decision thread 017 opened for WeekListCard's full-screen role.

## 2026-07-02 — Planning: Decision 011a logged (OPEN) + 011 pointer
Recorded Decision 011a (OPEN) — shopping dish/ingredient checkbox nesting,
blocked on the pending read-only Steps investigation. Added a "See 011a"
pointer under Decision 011. No source touched. Flagged for later reconciliation:
"R4" and "R5" are referenced elsewhere but not defined in this log — R4 is
folded into 011a pending the investigation; R5 (WeekListCard as Level-1
container) remains undefined and needs its own entry.

## 2026-07-02 — S0: task Steps parent/child checkbox investigation (READ-ONLY, I1–I4)
Investigated task Steps (`useTaskStore.ts` / `PlanTaskCard.tsx`) in the
All-the-small-things repo (source of truth — the UnFocus rebuild's stub
`useTaskStore.ts` has no `steps` field yet, only the Decision 015 minimal
`toggle()` contract). No source touched in either repo.

- **I1 — Does a Steps checklist exist, and where.** Yes.
  `All-the-small-things/store/useTaskStore.ts` defines `TaskStep` (`id`,
  `taskId`, `title`, `done`, `orderIndex`) backed by a separate `task_steps`
  SQLite table (own migration, own index). Rendered in
  `components/PlanTaskCard.tsx` (lines ~430–494) and `app/task-form.tsx`
  (~447+) as a checklist under the task, with add/toggle/remove/reorder rows.

- **I2 — Is it two-way bound to the parent task's done state (roll-up /
  roll-down)?** No. `toggle(id)` (the task-level done toggle,
  `useTaskStore.ts:191`) calls `get().update(id, { done: willBeDone })` and
  fires the `task_completed` automation trigger — it never reads or writes
  `task.steps`. Conversely `toggleStep(id)` (`useTaskStore.ts:240`) finds the
  owning task, flips only that one step's `done` via
  `updateRow('task_steps', ...)`, and never reads or writes the owning
  task's `done`. No roll-up (all steps done → task done) or roll-down (task
  done → all steps done) logic exists anywhere in the store, `PlanTaskCard.tsx`,
  or `task-form.tsx`. The two `done` booleans are written by completely
  disjoint code paths.

- **I3 — Derived vs. stored.** Both are stored, independently. Step `done`
  persists immediately to `task_steps.done` on every `toggleStep()` call (no
  draft/save gate — confirmed by the file header's own note: "steps persist
  straight to SQLite on every change"). Task `done` persists to `tasks.done`
  via the separate `update()`/`toggle()` path. Neither is computed from the
  other at read time (no derivation in `load()`'s row-grouping either — it
  just attaches `steps: byTask.get(t.id) ?? []` to each task, no aggregation).

- **I4 — Any other parent/child checkbox precedent in the old repo, in case
  Steps isn't the only candidate?** Checked `useMealStore` / `app/meals.tsx`'s
  dish→ingredients relationship, since `PlanTaskCard.tsx`'s own comment cites
  it as steps' style precedent ("mirrors app/meals.tsx's ingredient list").
  It is not a checkbox pattern at all — dish ingredients are a recipe list
  collected at dish-creation time with no `done`/checked field anywhere on
  `Ingredient`. No other dish/ingredient or group/item checkbox nesting
  exists anywhere else in the old repo. Steps was the only candidate, and it
  has no two-way binding to reuse.

**Conclusion for Decision 011a:** lands on the resolution tree's "no
reusable pattern" branch — "Steps are an independent immediate-persist
checklist with no roll-up/roll-down." Per that branch, 011a's three
remaining open questions (dish-checkbox-exists-at-all, derived-vs-stored for
the dish state, un-check semantics if adopted) must be decided fresh, not
copied from an existing pattern, and Decision 011a itself already flags them
as "no coding session may pick these silently." No source touched; this
entry is read-only per S0's scope.

## 2026-07-02 — S1 planning: Decision 011a resolved + drag-sequencing correction

**Status: Complete.** No source touched — decisions/plan docs only.

**011a resolution (user-decided, no code-derivable answer existed):**
Presented as numbered questions per the S0 conclusion above. User chose:
(1) dish checkbox exists, full two-way bind (roll-up + roll-down); (2) state
model is derived, not stored — no persisted dish-level flag, tapping the
dish checkbox bulk-writes its ingredients' `checked` field instead. Un-check
semantics fold into roll-down (no separate case, since there's nothing
stored to un-check independently). Recorded in REBUILD_DECISIONS.md, Decision
011a now **Resolved**. R4 (derived-vs-stored ripple) given its formal
definition there; R5 (WeekListCard Level-1 container, previously a dangling
reference) formally closed by pointer to Decision 017, which already
resolved it in full.

**Drag-reorder sequencing correction (user-decided):** re-verified the
queue's assumption that Session A2·1 (ShoppingRow) could run before Phase
3d. It cannot — PROGRESS_LOG's 2026-07-01 entry already recorded a STOPPED
session on exactly this gap (`DraggableTaskRow` not yet ported into this
repo, scoped to Phase 3d, which hadn't run) and explicitly flagged the fix
as a user-level scope call. Presented three options; user chose to run all
of **Phase 3d before Session A2·1**, rather than pulling only
`DraggableTaskRow` forward alone or having shopping build its own drag
primitive. This also satisfies Decision 009 Session B's precondition (which
separately requires `DraggableTaskRow` ported), so one port unblocks two
downstream consumers. Recorded in REBUILD_DECISIONS.md (Decision 011 R1 +
Packaging) and REBUILD_PLAN.md (3c/3d bullets updated in place — no
renumbering of phases, just an explicit run-order note).

**PlanTaskCard batch-placement — confirmed, not re-decided:** the record
already correctly placed PlanTaskCard in Decision 009's Session B (Plans
phase), not the Phase 3c cards-and-rows batch — the 3c audit's "BUILD, not a
port" framing and REBUILD_PLAN.md's existing 3c bullet already said this.
Made it explicit in REBUILD_PLAN.md's 3c bullet so a future Phase-3c-remainder
session prompt doesn't have to re-derive it. No change to Decision 009.

**Corrected next step:** the original queue (S2 = Session A2·1) is
superseded by the sequencing correction above. Next Code session is **Phase
3d** (DayTimeline, DraggableTaskRow, DatePickerCalendar, AddFAB,
AddSourceChooser, EnergyCheckIn), sourced from the All-the-small-things repo.
Session A2·1 (ShoppingRow) follows once 3d is logged done here.

## 2026-07-02 — Phase 3d: Timeline & interaction — ported (DraggableTaskRow generalized)

**Status: Complete.** All six components ported from the All-the-small-things
repo: `DayTimeline`, `DraggableTaskRow`, `DatePickerCalendar`, `AddFAB`,
`AddSourceChooser`, `EnergyCheckIn`. None are mounted anywhere yet (no call
sites exist until their respective screen phases) — same "ports ahead of
their screens" pattern as Phase 3a/3b/3c's un-gated components.

**Preconditions checked first:** `react-native-gesture-handler` (^3.0.0) and
`react-native-reanimated` (^4.4.1) already in `package.json`;
`GestureHandlerRootView` already wraps the app root in `app/_layout.tsx` — no
new native dependency needed for `DraggableTaskRow`. `Surface`, `useAppTheme`,
`lib/haptics`, `lib/date`, `BottomNav` (`BOTTOM_NAV_HEIGHT`) all confirmed
present from earlier phases.

**Load-bearing finding — `DraggableTaskRow` was not portable as-is, contrary
to the queue's assumption:** the old file doesn't just couple to
`app/plans.tsx` for hit-testing (already known from the 3c audit) — it
directly imports and hardcodes `<PlanTaskCard task={task} {...cardProps} />`
as its rendered child. `PlanTaskCard` is a **BUILD, not a port**, scoped to
Decision 009's Session B (Plans phase), which is sequenced far later in the
queue (Phase 6, alongside the Plans screen) — it doesn't exist in this repo
and, per 009a/009b, the eventual real one won't even look like the old app's
version. Porting the hardcoded old file verbatim here would have either
failed to compile or forced building a throwaway old-style `PlanTaskCard`
early, against a design the record already superseded.

**Resolution (mechanical, code-derivable — not escalated):** generalized
`DraggableTaskRow` to take `children: React.ReactNode` instead of a
`task`/`cardProps` pair. The gesture logic (activateAfterLongPress(180),
failOffsetX, the lift/scale/shadow animation, onRowLayout/onDragStart/
onDragMove/onDragEnd reporting) is byte-for-byte identical to the old file —
`task` was never read for gesture purposes in the original either, only
handed through to the hardcoded `<PlanTaskCard>` call, so removing it drops
zero behavior. This is consistent with the component's own header, which
already claimed it "owns no task data" — the hardcoded child was the one
place that wasn't actually true. Both future consumers (Session A2·1's
`ShoppingRow` drag reorder and Session B's `PlanTaskCard` drag reorder)
instantiate it with their own row in `children`.

**Store stub extensions (Decision 015-style):**
- `store/useTaskStore.ts` — added `done: boolean` and `importance: string` to
  the `Task` stub for `DayTimeline`'s dimming/star-indicator logic. No
  existing consumer (`NextTaskCard`, `QuickAddSheet`) constructs a `Task`
  object literal, so widening the type is non-breaking.
- `store/useEnergyStore.ts` — new stub (`levels`/`setToday()` only, the
  fields `EnergyCheckIn` reads/calls) — first Decision 015 stub for this
  store. Full contract (`load()`, `todayLevel()`) is Phase 5's job.

**Token remapping applied (Decision 006):** same remap table as prior
Phase 3 sessions — orange/orangeLight→accent/accentSoft, white→surface
(fill) or accentInk/textInverse (text-on-color), grayLight/offWhite→
surfaceMuted, textLight→textMuted, green/greenLight→good/goodSoft (used in
`AddSourceChooser`'s "from inventory" affordance — first port to need the
success/good pair for a non-semantic-state decorative purpose).

**`theme` prop dropped (established Phase 3c convention, applied here):**
`DatePickerCalendar` and `AddSourceChooser` took `theme: AppColors` as a
prop in the old app. Following the same convention `NoteRow`/`MonthlyTableRow`
already established ("no longer threaded in as a prop... reads useAppTheme()
internally, consistent with every other ported component"), both now call
`useAppTheme()` internally instead. Their prop signatures are narrower than
the old app's as a result — not yet exercised by a real call site, so no
ripple to anything else.

**Not evaluated this session:** typecheck (`npx tsc --noEmit`) could not run
— no `node_modules` in this remote environment, consistent with CLAUDE.md's
"local-only" note. Manual review only; flagging for the next local session
to run the typecheck pass.

**Unblocks:** Decision 011 R1's sequencing gate (Session A2·1 can now run —
`DraggableTaskRow`'s gesture pattern is ported and reusable via `children`)
and Decision 009 Session B's `DraggableTaskRow`-ported precondition (the
other precondition, `PlanTaskCard`, remains its own BUILD when Session B
actually runs).

## 2026-07-02 — Phase 3c, Session A2·1: ShoppingRow redesign — ported

**Status: Complete.** `components/ShoppingRow.tsx` built per Decision 011
A2-2 (two-line row, price total on line 1, qty+stepper+in-stock on line 2).
Ripples R1 (drag reorder), R2 (swipe-left remove, catalog/ad-hoc branch),
R3 (`CHECKED_OPACITY` export) all addressed.

**Gates checked first:** Decision 011 (Resolved) and its R1 addendum
(`DraggableTaskRow` children-based API) present; the 2026-07-02 "Phase 3d"
entry confirmed and `components/DraggableTaskRow.tsx` read directly —
children-based API verified before writing any drag-related code; Decision
015 `useShoppingStore` stub present. All four gates met, no stop.

**R1 (drag reorder) — resolved by composition, not by this component:**
`ShoppingRow` does not wrap itself in `DraggableTaskRow` and carries no
drag-related props (the old inline move-up/move-down chevrons are gone
entirely, not kept as a fallback). Per Decision 011 R1's 2026-07-02
resolution, the Phase 3d port made `DraggableTaskRow` take `children` — the
Session A2·2 shopping screen is what wraps `<DraggableTaskRow><ShoppingRow
.../></DraggableTaskRow>` and owns the actual reorder persistence. This
session only had to confirm the children API exists and design `ShoppingRow`
to compose cleanly as a plain child (no special layout requirements it
imposes on a wrapper).

**R2 (swipe-left remove) — new gesture surface, same store-action branch:**
Implemented as a `Gesture.Pan`, disambiguated from vertical scrolling the
same way `components/SiteSwipeView.tsx` already does
(`activeOffsetX([-12, 12])` + `failOffsetY([-10, 10])`) — the only other
real horizontal-swipe precedent in this codebase; reused rather than
inventing new thresholds. No working "swipe-to-close" implementation
actually exists anywhere in either repo despite ANIMATION_GUIDELINES.md's
haptics table listing one (checked directly — zero `Gesture.Pan`/
`PanGestureHandler` hits in `AddItemSheet.tsx` or any sheet); the row's
swipe design is original but stays inside the documented haptics contract
(§4: `selection()` on crossing a gesture threshold, `heavy()` on a
destructive-adjacent commit, both fired at the moment of the visual event).
Swipe past `COMMIT_THRESHOLD` (-64px) or a fast flick
(`SWIPE_VELOCITY_THRESHOLD`, 800 — same magnitude `SiteSwipeView` uses)
animates the row off-screen and calls `onRemove`; short of that snaps back.
`reducedMotion` skips the slide/snap animations (haptics still fire),
matching `DayTimeline`/`DraggableTaskRow`'s existing gating pattern. The
catalog-vs-ad-hoc branch is preserved exactly (`item.fromCatalog` on
non-purchased rows reveals `InventoryIcon`; everything else reveals a plain
"×") — `ShoppingRow` still only decides which icon/reveal-tint to show, the
parent's `onRemove` decides which store action actually runs, unchanged
from the old row.

**Precondition gap filled inline: `InventoryIcon.tsx` pulled forward from
its Phase 3e slot.** R2 can't preserve the catalog/ad-hoc icon distinction
without it. Unlike the `DraggableTaskRow`/`PlanTaskCard` situation, this is
a 12-line, single-consumer, zero-design-risk leaf (an `Ionicons` wrapper) —
pulling it forward doesn't touch anything not yet built, doesn't require
a design call, and doesn't set a precedent for pulling the rest of 3e
forward. Flagging in case a later session disagrees and wants it re-homed
to a proper 3e batch instead — no functional risk either way.

**Store stub extension (Decision 015-style, as pre-authorized by this
session's brief):** `store/useShoppingStore.ts`'s `ShoppingItem` widened
with `amount`/`unit`/`checked`/`collected`/`fromCatalog`/`inventoryQty` (the
row can't render without them) and the action surface widened with
`toggleCheck`/`toggleCollected`/`adjustAmount`/`putBackToInventory`/
`removeWithSource`/`reorder` typed stubs — signatures mirror the old app's
store 1:1. `ShoppingRow` itself doesn't call any of these (dumb-row pattern,
same as `NoteRow`/`MonthlyTableRow` — it only fires
`onToggle`/`onCollect`/`onRemove`/`onIncrement`/`onDecrement` callbacks);
they're staged now so Session A2·2's screen doesn't hit a stub gap mid-session.
No existing consumer (`ShoppingQuickAddSheet`, `UpdateSheet`,
`MonthlyTableRow`) constructs a `ShoppingItem` object literal, so widening
the type is non-breaking.

**Token remapping applied (Decision 006):** green→good, orange→accent,
white(icon-on-fill)→textInverse, gray→textMuted, textLight→textMuted,
danger→bad, grayLight(stepper disabled)→border, and `brown`(stepper
enabled)→`accent` — reusing the `brown`→`accent` remap already recorded
earlier in this log rather than inventing a new mapping for the same old
token. `theme` prop dropped in favor of internal `useAppTheme()`, matching
the established Phase 3c/3d convention.

**Design-system verification (per this session's brief):** checked
ANIMATION_GUIDELINES.md (haptics timing/contract — no real swipe-gesture
code exists to mirror, so the SiteSwipeView precedent + the documented
haptics rules were used instead, noted above), SPACING_LAYOUT_LIBRARY.md
(row's own `Spacing.sm` vertical padding matches the old row and doesn't
conflict with the "space between list items" `Spacing.md` guidance, which
governs the *list's* inter-row gap, not this row's internal padding), and
CARD_CONTAINER_LIBRARY.md (`Radius.md` used for the swipe-reveal panel,
matching the documented standard card radius).

**Dropped from the old row, per A2-2's own spec:** the separate "kr/stk"
per-unit price meta text — A2-2 only specifies a line-1 total and a line-2
qty/stepper/in-stock trio; the per-unit price isn't mentioned and A2-2's own
rationale (money glanceable via the total) is already served without it.

**Not evaluated this session:** typecheck (`npx tsc --noEmit`) could not run
— no `node_modules` in this remote environment, consistent with CLAUDE.md's
"local-only" note.

**Out of scope, flagged not touched:** shopping screen re-layout (A2-1/A2-4,
→ Session A2·2), `WeekListCard` and the 011a/R4 dish-group checkbox wiring
(→ 3c remainder), `PlanTaskCard` (→ Session B), any real store logic
(→ Phase 5).

**Unblocks:** Session A2·2 (shopping screen re-layout) — `ShoppingRow` is
now the finished component the screen composes.

## 2026-07-02 — Phase 3c remainder (WeekListCard): STOPPED before porting (Gate 2 unmet — Session A2·2 not run)

**Status: STOPPED, flagged.** No source touched. `WeekListCard.tsx` not
built, not mounted. `lib/shoppingGroups.ts` not pulled forward.

**Gates checked first (per session brief):**
1. Decision 017 (WeekListCard full-screen role) and Decision 011a
   (dish/ingredient checkbox nesting, incl. R4) — both confirmed **Resolved**
   as real structured entries in REBUILD_DECISIONS.md. MET.
2. **Session A2·2 logged done (the screen this card mounts into exists) —
   FAILED.** No PROGRESS_LOG entry exists for a Session A2·2 (shopping
   screen re-layout: sticky header per A2-1, scrolling body, A2-4 history/
   reset placement). `app/shopping.tsx` does not exist anywhere in this
   repo — `app/` currently contains only `_layout.tsx`, `_scaffold-demo.tsx`,
   `index.tsx`. The prior entry in this log (Session A2·1: ShoppingRow)
   explicitly states it "**Unblocks:** Session A2·2 (shopping screen
   re-layout)" as the *next* session to run, not one already completed.
   `git log` on this branch confirms the same — the most recent commit is
   the ShoppingRow port; nothing after it touches a shopping screen.
3. `ExpandableCard`, `ShoppingRow` present in this repo — confirmed
   (`components/ExpandableCard.tsx`, `components/ShoppingRow.tsx`). MET.

**Why this stops the whole session:** scope item 3 of the brief requires
mounting WeekListCard "into app/shopping.tsx where A2·2 left its slot" —
that slot doesn't exist. Decision 017 itself defines WeekListCard's
container role (list-level chrome minus the summary/progress block, which
now lives in A2·2's sticky header) as something that composes against a
screen-level sticky header that hasn't been built. Building WeekListCard's
full-screen role now would mean silently inventing or pre-deciding A2·2's
screen layout mid-session — exactly what this session's own gate
instruction is designed to prevent.

**Scope item 1 (verify NextTaskCard/NoteRow/MonthlyTableRow) — checked,
already done:** all three are already ported and present in `components/`
(logged complete 2026-07-01, "Phase 3c (partial): port un-gated cards &
rows"). No action needed, no re-port performed.

**Not done, so not evaluated this session:** WeekListCard build (container
role, ExpandableCard convergence for ungrouped rows, dish-group 011a/R4
derived-checkbox wiring), `lib/shoppingGroups.ts` pull-forward, mounting
into `app/shopping.tsx`.

**Left unresolved / next steps:**
1. Session A2·2 (shopping screen re-layout: sticky compact header per A2-1,
   scrolling body order, hint inline, shared-requests, collapsed
   bought-history, reset-in-overflow per A2-4) needs to run and be logged
   done in PROGRESS_LOG.md before this WeekListCard session can proceed.
2. Once A2·2 lands: re-run this session's scope (WeekListCard build +
   mount) against Decision 017 + 011a/R4 exactly as specified in the
   original brief — no re-decision needed, only the missing precondition.

**Out of scope, unaffected:** `PlanTaskCard` (→ Session B), real store logic
(→ Phase 5) — untouched, as instructed. This entry does NOT close Phase 3c —
the WeekListCard piece remains open pending Session A2·2.

## 2026-07-02 — Phase 3e: Icons, pickers, misc leaves — STOPPED before porting (Gate 1 unmet — Phase 3c not logged complete)

**Status: STOPPED, flagged.** No source touched. None of the batch (HabitIcon,
HuePicker, SwatchPicker, QRCodeDisplay, SaveButton, StickySaveBar,
`InboxSection` refactor, SharedRequestsSection, SavedListsModal,
MonthlyResetSummaryModal, Pet, SiteSwipeView, DebugOverlay) ported this
session.

**Gates checked first (per this session's brief):**
1. **Phase 3c logged complete (P2's closing entry) — FAILED.** The most
   recent PROGRESS_LOG entry (immediately above, 2026-07-02 "Phase 3c
   remainder (WeekListCard): STOPPED before porting") explicitly states "This
   entry does NOT close Phase 3c — the WeekListCard piece remains open
   pending Session A2·2." Confirmed directly, not just by reading the log
   prose: `WeekListCard.tsx` and `lib/shoppingGroups.ts` do not exist
   anywhere in this repo, and `app/shopping.tsx` does not exist either
   (filesystem search, zero hits). `git log` confirms the same — the most
   recent Phase-3c-related commit is the WeekListCard STOP entry
   (`2407cd0`), not a closing/completion entry. Session A2·2 (shopping
   screen re-layout, Decision 011 A2-1/A2-4) has not run.
2. Decision 009 (Session A InboxSection spec) — confirmed **Resolved** in
   REBUILD_DECISIONS.md, with an explicit spec (Surface→ExpandableCard
   refactor + inline edit-of-existing-note via the existing `/capture?id=`
   route, per Decision 009 Session A + Decision 012). MET.
3. `ExpandableCard` present — confirmed at `components/ExpandableCard.tsx`
   (ported Phase 3a, 2026-07-01). MET.

**Why this stops the whole session:** Gate 1 as literally stated in this
session's brief requires Phase 3c logged complete before 3e starts, and it
isn't — one item (WeekListCard) is still open, itself gated on a screen
session (A2·2) that hasn't run. Per this session's own "STOP and report if
any is unmet" instruction, honoring the gate literally rather than reasoning
past it.

**Noted for the record, not acted on:** none of the thirteen 3e items
actually depend on WeekListCard or `app/shopping.tsx` — the unmet gate is a
phase-sequencing precondition, not a per-component dependency block. Flagging
this in case the user wants to make an explicit scope call to run 3e ahead of
Session A2·2 (same kind of call already made once for Phase 3d before Session
A2·1) — not something to decide unilaterally mid-session.

**Left unresolved / next steps:**
1. Session A2·2 (shopping screen re-layout: sticky compact header per A2-1,
   scrolling body order, hint inline, shared-requests, collapsed
   bought-history, reset-in-overflow per A2-4) needs to run and be logged
   done in PROGRESS_LOG.md.
2. Once A2·2 lands, the previously-stopped Phase 3c remainder (WeekListCard
   build + mount) can complete, genuinely closing Phase 3c.
3. Once Phase 3c is closed, re-run this same Phase 3e prompt — no
   re-decision needed, only the missing precondition. All findings above
   (gates 2 and 3 met, known-already-done items InventoryIcon/GradientSwatch)
   still hold and don't need re-verification.

**Not done, so not evaluated this session:** all thirteen 3e items and their
individual scope details (InboxSection's inline note-editing per Decision
009/012, the Decision 006 token remap, `useAppTheme()`/`useT()` usage, etc.).

**Superseded by Session A2·2 below:** this stop turned out to be short-lived
— Session A2·2 (run in a separate chat in parallel) independently hit the
same missing-`app/shopping.tsx`/`WeekListCard` blocker and, on user
direction, absorbed the WeekListCard build into its own scope rather than
waiting on a dedicated follow-up session. See the next two entries below.

**Resolved by the next entry below:** this session ran in parallel with,
and merged after, Session A2·2 (shopping screen re-layout) — which, on
hitting the same missing-`app/shopping.tsx` blocker independently, absorbed
WeekListCard's build into its own (user-expanded) scope rather than waiting
on a separate session. `WeekListCard.tsx` and `lib/shoppingGroups.ts` are
therefore already built — see "Session A2·2: Shopping screen re-layout —
built" immediately below. Nothing further is needed from this entry's
"next steps."

## 2026-07-02 — Session A2·2: Shopping screen re-layout — built (scope expanded)

**Status: Complete, but well outside the session's original brief.** The brief's four
gates (PROGRESS_LOG entry, Decision 011 resolved, `ShoppingRow`/`DraggableTaskRow` exist,
`useShoppingStore` stub staged) all held. What the brief *assumed but didn't gate on* —
that `app/shopping.tsx` and `components/WeekListCard.tsx` already existed and only
needed a layout pass — did not hold: neither file, nor three of the four other
components the old screen composes (`SharedRequestsSection`, `SavedListsModal`,
`MonthlyResetSummaryModal` — all Phase 3e, unported; `SiteSwipeView` also unported but
dropped, see below), had ever been created in this repo. Stopped and reported this to
the user twice (once on discovering `WeekListCard`/`app/shopping.tsx` didn't exist, once
after discovering the three Phase 3e components didn't exist either); the user chose to
expand scope both times ("port WeekListCard first, then build the screen", then "fully
port all three now") rather than defer to a later session. This entry documents the
resulting session as actually run, not the original brief.

**What actually got built, beyond the brief's stated scope:**
- `components/WeekListCard.tsx` — **new file**, did not exist. Built fresh against
  Decision 011 (A2-1/A2-4/R1/R3) and Decision 017 rather than ported byte-for-byte from
  the old repo, which wrapped everything in the old padlock-gated `Container.tsx`.
  `Container.tsx` is NOT ported — `ExpandableCard.tsx`'s own header already documented
  itself as this card's intended base (Decision 009), so Container is superseded, not a
  gap. Owns list-level chrome (rename, lock, saved-lists/list-settings/delete icons —
  Decision 017 Q1), a compact inline progress line for non-focused lists only (Decision
  017 Q3/Q4's bounded amendment — tapping it calls `onFocus`), dish groups + a collapsed
  "Bought this week (n)" `ExpandableCard` (Decision 011 A2-4, replacing the old always-
  visible "In cart" section), and the "Shopping done!" button (dimmed via `ShoppingRow`'s
  exported `CHECKED_OPACITY`, Decision 011 R3 — this button lived here in the old app
  too, not at screen level). Does NOT wrap its own reorderable rows in `DraggableTaskRow`
  — takes a `renderReorderableRow` prop instead, so the parent screen can own reorder
  hit-testing per Decision 011 R1's session split (see below).
- `app/shopping.tsx` — **new file**, did not exist (not even a placeholder — this repo's
  `app/` had only `_layout.tsx`, `_scaffold-demo.tsx`, `index.tsx` before this session).
  Built from scratch against Decision 011/017, using the old repo's `app/shopping.tsx`
  only as a behavior/copy reference, not a port target.
- `components/SharedRequestsSection.tsx`, `components/SavedListsModal.tsx`,
  `components/MonthlyResetSummaryModal.tsx` — **new files**, Phase 3e components pulled
  forward out of plan order (REBUILD_PLAN.md 3e hasn't run). `SavedListsModal`/
  `MonthlyResetSummaryModal` rebuilt on `<Surface surfaceContext="overlay">` (this repo's
  established sheet pattern — see `ListSettingsSheet.tsx`/`UpdateSheet.tsx`) instead of
  the old repo's bare `View` + `theme.white` + `Shadow.fab` — "Surface owns card/glass"
  per this session's standing constraints, not a literal port.
- `components/SiteSwipeView.tsx` (swipe-between-screens wrapper) — **not ported**,
  flagged rather than pulled forward like the other three. Not required by A2-1/A2-4,
  lower necessity than shared-requests/reset/saved-lists which A2-4's own body-order spec
  names directly. Still a Phase 3e gap.
- `store/useSharedStore.ts` — **new file**, Decision-015-style stub. Didn't exist at all;
  `SharedRequestsSection` can't render without it. `kind='task'` branch dropped from the
  ported component (app/index.tsx doesn't exist yet — out of scope, re-add in Phase 6).
- `store/useShoppingStore.ts` / `store/useShoppingListStore.ts` — extended well past
  Session A2·1's staged surface: full `items`/`trips` state, `update`/
  `addToWeeklyFromCatalog`/`setPendingRestock`/`confirmStagingTray`/`doneShopping`/
  `monthlyReset`/`buildMonthlyResetSummary` actions, `MonthlyResetSummary` type,
  `ShoppingItem` widened with `dishName?`/`orderIndex?`/`listId?`/`status`/
  `purchasedAt?`/`shoppingTripId?`; `ShoppingList` widened with `name`/`locked`/
  `isTemplate`/`startDate`/`endDate`; `lists` state plus `rename`/`toggleLocked`/
  `setRecurring`/`advanceRecurringLists`/`saveAsTemplate`/`instantiateTemplate`/`add`/
  `remove`. `useShoppingStore` also gained a Zustand-shaped `getState()` (the old screen
  calls it outside a component). Same minimal-contract precedent as every Decision 015
  stub — mirrors the old app's store signatures where a ported consumer reads them;
  `category` dropped (nothing here reads it).
- `lib/shoppingGroups.ts` — **new file**, direct port of `groupByDish`/`computeListGroups`
  plus a new `listProgress()` helper (not in the old repo) so the sticky header (focused
  list) and `WeekListCard`'s compact line (non-focused lists) share ONE progress
  calculation rather than forking it — Decision 017 note 3's explicit requirement.
- `components/ScreenScaffold.tsx` — added an optional `stickyBelowHeader`/
  `stickyBelowHeaderHeight` prop pair (additive, backward-compatible — every existing
  caller renders identically when omitted). Decision 011 A2-1 needs a screen-level sticky
  bar under the header that survives scrolling; ScreenScaffold is Decision 001's mandated
  universal wrapper, so extending it beat hand-rolling a second copy of its L1-L5 layer
  stack inside `app/shopping.tsx` alone. Uses the same absolute-position-plus-zIndex float
  pattern as the header/bottom-nav blocks, not `ScrollView.stickyHeaderIndices` (would sit
  underneath the already-absolutely-positioned header).
- `app/_layout.tsx` — mounted `<AppModalHost/>` (was never mounted anywhere). Its own
  header already said this should happen "during the screens phase" — `app/shopping.tsx`
  is the first real screen needing `showAppModal()` (delete-list confirm, done-shopping
  receipt choice, manual monthly-reset confirm, new-list chooser).

**A2-1 sticky header — design-system verification (per the brief's own instruction):**
checked SHADOW_ELEVATION_LIBRARY.md and CARD_CONTAINER_LIBRARY.md — both are stale
relative to Decision 008's real-blur `Surface` redesign (still reference `Shadow.card`/
`theme.white` from the pre-006/008 token system; flagged as a doc-vs-source conflict, not
fixed here, out of scope). Went with `Surface`'s own docstring instead, which explicitly
names `surfaceContext="overlay"` for "sticky headers... nav bar" — used that. Notable:
`ScreenHeader.tsx`/`BottomNav.tsx` both actually use the `ambient` default despite being
comparable floating chrome, a real inconsistency with `Surface`'s own stated rule — not
fixed here either (shared foundation files, out of scope), just flagged.

**Decision 011 R1 reorder wiring:** screen-owned, per the decision's explicit session
split. `app/shopping.tsx` collects each rendered row's layout (`rowLayouts` ref, keyed
`listId:itemId`), does hit-testing on drag-move (`computeTargetIndex`, comparing the
dragged row's live centerY against a snapshot of sibling layouts captured at drag-start),
reflows the live preview via `LayoutAnimation.configureNext` (same idiom
`ExpandableCard.tsx` already uses) each time the computed insertion index changes, and on
drag-end calls `useShoppingStore.reorder(id, 'up'|'down')` once per index step crossed
between drag-start and drag-end. Only the "Shopping list" (ungrouped-unchecked) section
is reorderable — matches the old inline move-chevrons' scope exactly; dish-group and
bought-history rows never had move affordances either. The hit-test snapshot is captured
once at drag-start and doesn't re-measure mid-drag, so it's an approximation, not
pixel-perfect — reasonable for a first cut with no live-app verification available.

**Mount-time store-action calls deliberately NOT wired (Phase 5 follow-up, not silently
dropped):** the old screen's `advanceRecurringLists(todayStr())` + `useShoppingStore
.getState().load()` mount effect, and its automatic payday-boundary monthly-reset
detection effect. Both call store-stub actions that throw until Phase 5 — calling either
unconditionally on mount would crash the screen on first load. Every action call in this
session's `app/shopping.tsx`/`WeekListCard.tsx` is instead behind a user-triggered
handler (onPress/onSubmitEditing/drag-end), the same accepted-safe pattern every other
already-shipped sheet in this repo (`AddItemSheet`, `UpdateSheet`, etc.) already uses —
those buttons also crash today if actually pressed, and that's the accepted state of this
whole codebase pre-Phase-5. The manual "Reset monthly list now" overflow action (A2-4's
own requirement) follows the same pattern and will start working the moment Phase 5 lands.

**Dropped from the old screen, flagged not silently absorbed:** the header's Share pill
(site-tier `ScreenHeader` has no custom-right slot, only sub-tier does — out of scope to
change); the `'shopping_opened'` automation trigger (`useAutomationStore` doesn't exist in
this repo); routing to `/scan` from "Shopping done!"'s receipt choice (`app/scan.tsx`
isn't ported — Scan/Upload/Skip all just commit the trip for now).

**Monthly/Katalog tab:** built as a light, functional but NOT redesigned port — Decision
011 A2-3 says Monthly "stays... untouched by A2-2," and A2-1/A2-4's own grounding note
scopes the redesign to the weekly tab specifically. `Surface` replaces the old `Container`
but section order/behavior is otherwise unchanged from the old app. Needed regardless —
without it the screen would only have one working tab.

**i18n:** 9 new keys added to both `en`/`no` (`boughtThisWeekSection`,
`savedListsButtonLabel`, `deleteListButtonLabel`, `listSettingsButtonLabel`,
`lockListButtonLabel`, `unlockListButtonLabel`, `resetMonthlyListAction`,
`resetMonthlyListConfirmTitle`, `resetMonthlyListConfirmBody`). Everything else needed
(hints.shopping, sharedRequests.*, every sheet's field/button copy) already existed from
earlier phases — confirmed before adding anything new, per token policy.

**Token remapping applied (Decision 006):** consistent with every prior 3b/3c/3d session
— orange→accent, green→good, white→surface (Surface-owned), grayLight→border/surfaceMuted
(context-dependent), textLight→textMuted, offWhite→surfaceMuted, hardcoded `'#fff'`→
textInverse, hardcoded `fontWeight`→`Fonts` tokens. `theme` prop dropped from every newly
ported component in favor of internal `useAppTheme()`.

**Not evaluated this session:** typecheck (`npx tsc --noEmit`) could not run — no
`node_modules` in this remote environment, consistent with CLAUDE.md's "local-only" note.
No live-app verification either (also consistent with current policy) — the reorder
hit-test math and the sticky bar's fixed `STICKY_HEIGHT` estimate are unverified against
a real render.

**Out of scope, flagged not touched:** `SiteSwipeView` (Phase 3e); `app/scan.tsx`,
`app/inventory-edit.tsx`, `app/index.tsx`/`useAutomationStore` (later phases); 011a/R4
dish-checkbox nesting wiring (already resolved in Decision 011a but not re-touched here —
this session's dish groups render read-only ingredient rows, no parent/child checkbox
binding attempted); `PlanTaskCard` (Session B); real store logic (Phase 5).

**Unblocks:** nothing further gated on this — Decision 011 (A2-1, A2-2, A2-4) and
Decision 017 are now fully built out, not just decided. Phase 5 (real store logic) is the
next thing that would make this screen actually functional end-to-end.

## 2026-07-02 — Phase 3e: Icons, pickers, misc leaves — ported (Phase 3 complete)

**Status: Complete.** Gate 1 (Phase 3c logged complete) — unmet at the start of this
session, per the STOPPED entry above — was resolved when the user confirmed Session
A2·2 had landed on `main` in a parallel chat; merged `origin/main` into this branch
(resolving a `PROGRESS_LOG.md` conflict by keeping both the stop entry and the A2·2
entry in sequence) before re-checking gates. All three gates then held: Phase 3c
closed (WeekListCard built during A2·2), Decision 009 Session A InboxSection spec
Resolved on file, `ExpandableCard` present. Ported the remainder of the 3e batch —
`SharedRequestsSection`/`SavedListsModal`/`MonthlyResetSummaryModal` were already done
(pulled forward during Session A2·2) and `InventoryIcon`/`GradientSwatch` were already
done from earlier phases, so this session's actual scope was: **HabitIcon, HuePicker,
SwatchPicker, QRCodeDisplay, SaveButton, StickySaveBar, InboxSection (refactor), Pet,
SiteSwipeView, DebugOverlay** — ten items. With this, **Phase 3 (composites) is fully
complete** (3a/3b/3c/3d/3e all logged done); `REBUILD_PLAN.md` updated accordingly.

**Old source located:** all ten read directly from the sibling `All-the-small-things`
repo (`components/HabitIcon.tsx`, `HuePicker.tsx`, `SwatchPicker.tsx`,
`QRCodeDisplay.tsx`, `SaveButton.tsx`, `SticklySaveBar.tsx` — note the old repo's own
filename typo, `InboxSection.tsx`, `Pet.tsx`, `SiteSwipeView.tsx`, `DebugOverlay.tsx`,
plus `constants/petData.ts` as a Pet.tsx dependency).

**Straight ports, no token remap needed:**
- **HabitIcon.tsx** — byte-for-byte; `color` is always caller-supplied, no app-chrome
  token read internally.
- **QRCodeDisplay.tsx** — byte-for-byte; black/white QR modules are a functional
  encoding (scanner contrast), not app chrome — same precedent as HomeHeroBackground's
  sky/orb palette for "this hex is decorative/functional, not Decision 006's job."
- **SiteSwipeView.tsx** — byte-for-byte; pure gesture/nav wiring, no colour tokens at
  all. `lib/siteNav.ts`/`lib/haptics.ts` (`selection`/`tug`) both already present from
  earlier phases — no new dependency gaps. Noted in the header that its
  `activeOffsetX([-12,12])`/`failOffsetY([-10,10])`/`SWIPE_VELOCITY_THRESHOLD=800`
  gesture thresholds are the same ones `ShoppingRow.tsx`'s swipe-to-remove already
  reused (Session A2·1) — flagged so both stay in sync if either changes.
- **HuePicker.tsx** — byte-for-byte logic; `hslToHex` already exists in
  `constants/theme.ts` under that exact name, no remap needed. Ported as an **inert
  leaf only** — Decision 006/007 explicitly deferred the runtime "custom" 7th theme
  (no `hueToCustomColors()`, no `custom` entry in `ThemeName`), so this component is
  not wired into anything and stays unmounted, same "ports ahead of its screen"
  precedent as every other Phase 3 composite. Flagged in the header so a later session
  doesn't read "HuePicker exists" as "custom theme is live."

**Token remap applied (Decision 006), `theme` prop dropped where present:**
- **SwatchPicker.tsx** — `theme.orange`→`accent`, `theme.textLight`→`textMuted`,
  `theme.border` unchanged. Already called `useAppTheme()` internally in the old
  source (no prop to drop). `Shadow.card`/`Shadow.cardHeavy` used unchanged — direct
  ring/shadow styling, not a `Surface` material, so Decision 008 doesn't apply here.
- **SaveButton.tsx** — `theme?.orange`→`accent` (fill), `theme?.white`→`accentInk`
  (text-on-fill pairing). `theme?: AppColors` prop dropped for internal
  `useAppTheme()`, established Phase 3c/3d convention. **Also fixed:** old source
  defaulted `label = 'Lagre'` (a hardcoded Norwegian string) — `label` is now a
  required prop with no fallback, matching the *same file's sibling* StickySaveBar's
  own stated principle ("no hardcoded Norwegian fallback text — caller passes i18n
  strings") and AGENTS.md's "all UI text through useT()" rule. Callers (settings.tsx,
  not ported yet) will pass `t.save`.
- **StickySaveBar.tsx** — ported from the old repo's `SticklySaveBar.tsx` (typo
  corrected to the plain-English filename `REBUILD_PLAN.md`'s 3e list already used).
  `theme?.offWhite`→`surfaceMuted`, `theme?.grayLight`→`border`, `theme?.textLight`→
  `textMuted`, `theme?.orange`→`accent`, hardcoded `'#FFFFFF'` save-button text→
  `accentInk`. `theme` prop dropped for internal `useAppTheme()`. `label`/`saveLabel`/
  `undoLabel` were already required (no hardcoded fallback) in the old source — kept
  as-is, no change needed there.
- **DebugOverlay.tsx** — `theme.border` unchanged, `theme.white`→`surface`,
  `theme.orange`→`accent`, `theme.grayLight`→`surfaceMuted` (note-box fill, sheet
  handle), `theme.text`→`text`, `theme.textLight`→`textMuted`, `theme.gray`→
  `textMuted` (placeholder colour), `theme.danger`→`bad`, hardcoded `'#fff'`
  composer-save text→`accentInk`. All `t.debug.*`/`t.resetConfirmTitle`/
  `t.resetConfirmBody`/`t.resetConfirmBtn`/`t.cancel`/`t.save`/`t.taskSavedSimple`
  i18n keys already existed in both `en`/`no` from earlier phases — confirmed before
  writing, no new i18n needed. Uses `AppModal`'s `showAppModal()` and
  `ConfirmationBanner` unchanged (both already ported, signatures matched exactly).
- **Pet.tsx** — only the speech bubble is app chrome: `theme.white`→`surface`,
  `theme.border`/`theme.text` unchanged names. Habitat backgrounds, floor colours, and
  food-chip emoji/colours stay fixed decorative hex in `constants/petData.ts` (ported
  near-verbatim) — same precedent as `HomeHeroBackground.tsx`'s sky/orb palette:
  illustrative art values, not semantic UI chrome, so Decision 006's token rule
  doesn't reach them.

**InboxSection.tsx — refactor, not a faithful port (Decision 009 Session A + Decision
012), gate 2 spec followed exactly:**
- Surface → the whole section is now **one `ExpandableCard`** (title = `t.inbox.
  sectionTitle`, `badge` = item count, `defaultOpen` for visibility parity with the
  old always-shown flat card) rather than per-item cards — matches Decision 009 #2's
  "all three Home previews render through the single ExpandableCard primitive."
  No "See more →" link added: unlike Plans/Shopping there's no separate full-inbox
  screen to route to (items get promoted or discarded, not browsed) — inventing one
  would exceed this component-only refactor's scope, so it's flagged rather than built.
- **Edit affordance — surfaced the existing route, did not invent inline text-edit
  state:** per the brief's own instruction ("surface the existing `/capture?id=` route
  as an edit affordance — don't invent a new store path"), the Edit button still
  routes to `/capture?id=`, just relocated into the new card's body instead of the old
  flat Surface row. Decision 012 already established this route as a shipped, working
  feature — this refactor doesn't touch that, only the surrounding card chrome.
- Preserved unchanged: one-tap →Task promotion with the same defaults (today's date,
  `start-at`, no recurrence, `regular` importance), Discard, `success()`-on-promote
  haptic (with `haptic={false}` on that `PressableScale` so it doesn't double-fire),
  Discard's default `PressableScale` tap haptic, render-nothing-when-empty (the
  `items.length === 0` guard still short-circuits before any `ExpandableCard` renders).
- Token remap: `theme.offWhite`(row divider)→`surfaceMuted`, `theme.orangeLight`/
  `theme.orange`→`accentSoft`/`accent` (promote pill), `theme.grayLight`→
  `surfaceMuted` (edit/discard pills), `theme.textLight`→`textMuted` (edit/discard
  pill text), `theme.text` unchanged.
- All `t.inbox.*` keys used (`sectionTitle`, `promote`, `edit`, `discard`) already
  existed in both `en`/`no` — confirmed before writing.

**Store stubs created/extended (Decision 015-style, pre-authorized by the session's
own "extend stubs only where a component can't compile without it" instruction):**
- `store/useInboxStore.ts` — **new file.** `items`/`add`/`update`/`remove`/
  `promoteToTask` typed surface, matching the old app's `useInboxStore.ts` contract.
  `promoteToTask`'s second argument is typed as `TaskInput` (imported from
  `useTaskStore.ts`) rather than re-deriving the old app's
  `Omit<Task, 'id' | 'steps'>` — this repo's `Task` stub has no `steps` field yet, so
  `TaskInput` is the exact match already used by `handlePromote()`'s call shape.
- `store/useFeedbackStore.ts` — **new file.** `notes`/`add`/`clearAll` typed surface
  for `DebugOverlay`; the old app's `load()` and legacy `screen`/`x`/`y` placeholder
  columns are a Phase 5 real-store implementation detail, not part of this
  component-facing contract, so they're not in the stub.
- `store/useShoppingStore.ts` — extended `ShoppingItem` with `category?: string`
  (optional), re-adding a field Session A2·2 had deliberately dropped as "nothing
  reads it yet" — `Pet.tsx`'s food-chip mapping is the first real reader. Also
  adapted `Pet.tsx` itself to read weekly-list membership via `status ===
  'inWeeklyList'` (this store's actual lifecycle field) instead of the old app's
  separate `listType` field, which this stub never carried — not a new store
  capability, just wiring Pet to the field names Session A2·2 already established.
- `constants/petData.ts` — **new file**, near-verbatim port (habitat/food emoji +
  decorative hex unchanged; only doc/connections header updated). Pure data + helper
  functions, no store entanglement.

**Verification:** ran `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` (fresh `node_modules`, same as
Phase 3c's precedent) and `npx tsc --noEmit`. 35 pre-existing errors, **zero** touching
any file this session created or modified (confirmed by grepping the output for every
new/changed filename — zero hits). The 35 are the same known family from prior
sessions (missing `expo-blur`/`expo-linear-gradient`/`react-native-svg`, old-token-name
screens not yet rewired to `ThemePalette`: `app/_layout.tsx`, `app/_scaffold-demo.tsx`,
`app/index.tsx`, `BottomNav.tsx`, `ScreenHeader.tsx`, `ScreenBackground.tsx`,
`ScreenScaffold.tsx`, `Surface.tsx`) plus one **not previously catalogued, flagged
here rather than fixed:** `app/shopping.tsx` calls `t.moreOptions` (top-level) twice,
but the key only exists nested at `t.habits.moreOptions` — a pre-existing gap from
Session A2·2 (not touched or introduced by this session; out of scope to fix here per
this session's own component-only scope).

**Merge note:** this branch had diverged from `main` (a Phase 3e stop-entry commit vs.
`main`'s Session A2·2 merge). Merged `origin/main` in before starting any port work,
resolving the `PROGRESS_LOG.md` conflict by hand (kept both entries, in sequence, with
a short pointer note) rather than picking one side. No other files conflicted.

**Not done, so not evaluated this session:** nothing — all ten items in this session's
actual scope landed. `PlanTaskCard` remains out of scope as always (Decision 009
Session B, a BUILD not a port).

**Out of scope, flagged not touched:** wiring any of these ten into their eventual
screens/mounts (`app/settings.tsx`, `app/index.tsx`, `app/_layout.tsx`'s
`DebugOverlay`/`SiteSwipeView` mounts, `app/onboarding/step5.tsx`/`step6.tsx`) — all
Phase 5/6 screen work, same "ports ahead of screens" pattern as every prior Phase 3
sub-phase. Real store logic for `useInboxStore`/`useFeedbackStore` (Phase 5). The
`app/shopping.tsx` `t.moreOptions` gap noted above.

**Phase 3 complete.**

## 2026-07-02 — Phase 4: flagged-for-redesign sweep

**Status: Gate met, partial completion — one component-level fix landed, two questions
compiled for the user (see bottom of this entry).** Gate ("Phase 3 logged complete") was
unmet at the start of this session (WeekListCard/Phase 3e both still open at that point);
confirmed resolved once Session A2·2 and the Phase 3e completion entry above both landed —
see the separate STOPPED-gate log entry earlier in this file and its supersession.

**Full enumeration of FEATURE_INVENTORY.docx's non-blank "Edit notes:" lines (extracted via
`python3`/`zipfile`, all 366 paragraphs read — not sampled):** exactly ten flagged items
exist in the whole document (everything else is a blank "Edit notes:" placeholder, not a
flag). Cross-referenced each against REBUILD_DECISIONS.md rather than trusting the task
brief's pre-supplied "known resolved" list at face value:

1. **Energy level, medium vs. high** ("No difference between medium and high") — tracked as
   **OB-2, open/deferred**. Per the stale-note protocol (two 2026-06-21 notes already proven
   stale — note-editing, habit reminders), checked this claim against the old repo's actual
   code rather than assuming it's also stale: grepped `lib/taskSuggestion.ts` and
   `app/plans.tsx` in `All-the-small-things` for every energy-level branch — both filter
   ONLY on `energy === 'low'` (`candidates.filter(t => t.importance === 'essential')`);
   there is no `medium`/`high` branch anywhere. **Confirmed accurate, not stale** — no
   inversion recorded (the protocol only requires recording an inversion when a claim turns
   out to be wrong; this one checked out true). Remains open — see Question 1 below.
2. **Plans day-view redesign** ("Need a better/easier way to view 'time now + rest of
   day'") — **resolved by decision** (009/009a/009b: read-only day-view, proportional rail,
   collapsed states, gap state, dimmed done zone, 10%-of-span rail tail). Not built yet —
   the decision itself scopes the actual construction to Decision 009's Session B, run
   alongside the full Plans screen (`REBUILD_PLAN.md` Phase 6, and `PlanTaskCard` is
   explicitly a BUILD not a port there). Cross off as resolved; **not pulled into this
   session** — building the Plans screen now would jump Phase 6 out of sequence, the same
   discipline every prior session in this log has held to.
3. **Bubble gradient colouring** ("Gradient colouring instead of today's look... letters
   must be the same colour and easy to read") — **moot**, per Decision 008 (5): BubbleMenu is
   dropped entirely, not redesigned. Cross off, no work.
4. **Bubble sizing** ("All bubbles the same size... big enough for the longest word") —
   same as #3, moot per Decision 008 (5). Cross off, no work.
5. **Sharing explanation copy** ("Add a short explanation of what sharing does there...
   wording TBD") — tracked as **OB-3, open, no decision**. Genuinely a copy/wording gap, not
   a stale claim (the explanatory strings don't exist anywhere in either repo — verified by
   grepping `lib/i18n.ts` in both repos for anything resembling per-location share copy;
   nothing found). Remains open — see Question 2 below.
6. **Shopping list overhaul, overall** ("Needs a big overhaul... I need input to make
   decisions") — **resolved (Decision 011) and fully built** (Session A2·2:
   `app/shopping.tsx` + `WeekListCard.tsx` shipped). Cross off, nothing left to do.
7. **Shopping screen order/crowding** ("Feels crowded — prime candidate for the redesign")
   — **resolved (Decision 011 A2-1) and built** (sticky header + scrolling body, same
   session as #6). Cross off, nothing left to do.
8. **Habit reminders, multiple per day** ("Add the option for several reminders a day...
   Today only ONE fixed time is possible") — **proven stale, already resolved** (Decision
   016: the multi-mode reminder picker already ships in the old app; the note predates that
   feature). Decision recorded; the actual form/store/notifications work is explicitly
   scoped to Phase 5/6 (habit-form.tsx, `useHabitStore`, `lib/habitNotifications`), none of
   which exist in this repo yet. Cross off as resolved-by-decision; **not pulled into this
   session** — same out-of-sequence reasoning as #2.
9. **Notes home preview — can't edit old notes** ("Lacks a way of fixing/editing existing
   notes") — **proven stale, already resolved** (Decision 012) **and the component-level fix
   is already built**: the Phase 3e `InboxSection` refactor (2026-07-02, logged above)
   explicitly surfaced the existing `/capture?id=` route as an in-card edit affordance. Cross
   off, nothing left to do at the component level (the screen it routes to, `capture.tsx`, is
   Phase 6 — components ported ahead of their screens, same pattern as the rest of Phase 3).
10. **"Edit an old note — doesn't exist yet"** ("This is the gap — add a way to open and
    change a note you saved earlier") — same claim as #9, same resolution. Cross off.

**Verification of the task brief's own "known resolved" list — one gap found, not just
rubber-stamped:** Decision 011a (shopping dish/ingredient checkbox nesting, part of the
"shopping overhaul (011/011a/017)" bucket the brief calls resolved) turned out to be
**resolved-but-not-implemented**. Session A2·2's own log entry explicitly flagged this out
of scope ("this session's dish groups render read-only ingredient rows, no parent/child
checkbox binding attempted"), despite R4's text naming "whichever session builds/finishes
WeekListCard's dish-group rendering... owns wiring this — it is not a separate session." No
FEATURE_INVENTORY line names this directly (011a was user-decided fresh, not sourced from an
edit note — see its own entry), but it's squarely inside the shopping-overhaul thread this
session is scoped to close out, has a fully recorded direction with zero ambiguity left, and
is small/self-contained — exactly what this session's instruction 3 authorizes ("For each
remaining item WITH recorded direction: do the component-level work now"). Built this session
(see below) rather than opening a new decision or a new session for it.

**Component-level work done — Decision 011a/R4 dish-checkbox wiring:**
- `lib/shoppingGroups.ts` — `computeListGroups()`'s dish grouping previously derived
  `dishGroups` from unchecked items only, which meant a fully-checked dish's items fell out
  of the group entirely into the flat "Bought this week" bucket, making Decision 011a's
  roll-up ("dish shows checked when every ingredient is checked") structurally
  unobservable. Fixed to group ALL of a list's items by dish first (checked + unchecked
  together), then split only the ungrouped remainder into `ungroupedUnchecked`/`checked`.
  Added `dishGroupAllChecked(items)` — the decision's "computed, never stored" derived
  value (011a decision #2). `listProgress()` updated to count dish items by their own
  `checked` state rather than treating whole-group membership as "remaining" (otherwise a
  checked dish ingredient would double-count as still-remaining after the grouping fix).
- `components/WeekListCard.tsx` — each dish-group `ExpandableCard` now renders a checkbox in
  `rightAction` (same 20px circle / `theme.good` fill / checkmark visual language as
  `ShoppingRow`'s own check button, for consistency) reading `dishGroupAllChecked(groupItems)`
  and calling the new `onToggleDish` prop on tap. Also fixed a related latent bug this
  surfaced: the "Shopping done!" button's disabled/dim state read `checked.length` (the flat
  bucket only), which would now under-count once dish items can carry their own checked
  state without ever appearing in that bucket — switched to `progress.inCart` (the same
  shared `listProgress()` total used by the sticky header) so a fully-checked dish alone is
  enough to enable the button.
- `app/shopping.tsx` — new `toggleDish(items)` handler: computes the target state (check all
  if not all are checked, uncheck all if all are — 011a decision #1/#3, no separate un-check
  case) and calls the existing per-item `useShoppingStore.toggleCheck` only for items not
  already at the target state (no new store action, per R4). Wired to `WeekListCard`'s new
  `onToggleDish` prop. Also fixed the same `checked.length`-undercounts-dish-items bug at the
  `handleDoneShopping` call site — now passes `listProgress(groups).inCart` instead of
  `groups.checked.length`.
- `lib/i18n.ts` — one new key pair, `dishCheckAllLabel` (en/no), the dish checkbox's
  accessibility label. Everything else needed already existed.
- Monthly/Katalog tab's own dish groups (`catalogDishGroups`) were checked and correctly
  left untouched — they're driven by `pendingRestock` (a staging flag), not `checked`, a
  different mechanism Decision 011a never named, and Decision 011 A2-3 keeps Monthly
  unredesigned regardless.

**Verification:** `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` + `npx tsc --noEmit` — 33 errors, **zero**
touching any file changed this session (confirmed by grepping the full output for
`WeekListCard|shoppingGroups|lib/i18n` — no hits; `app/shopping.tsx`'s two hits are both the
pre-existing `t.moreOptions` gap flagged in the Phase 3e entry above, untouched by this
session). Count is down from the prior session's 35 (same pre-existing family: missing
native libs, old-token-name screens) — not a regression.

**Not done, out of scope, flagged not touched:** items #2 and #8 above (Plans day-view,
habit reminders) — both fully decided, both explicitly scheduled to their own later
phase/session, not pulled forward. BubbleMenu (#3/#4) — moot, not touched. `app/capture.tsx`
(Phase 6) — InboxSection's edit route still points at a screen that doesn't exist yet, same
as every other "component ported ahead of its screen" precedent in this repo.

---

### Question compilation (per this session's instruction 4 — no direction decided here)

**Question 1 — Energy check-in: what should medium and high actually DO differently?**
Confirmed accurate (not stale, see item 1 above): today only `low` does anything (narrows
tasks to `importance === 'essential'`); medium and high are identical no-ops. The Home
Energy check-in is currently unmounted anyway (Decision 009), so this doesn't block any
in-flight work — but it should be decided before Energy ever resurfaces on a screen.

- **A. Give medium a real middle tier** — low → essential only (unchanged); medium →
  essential + important; high → everything (unchanged, matches today's implicit fallback).
  Directly fixes the flagged complaint with the smallest change (one new filter branch,
  reuses the existing `importance` field, no new UI). *Recommended.*
- **B. Collapse to two levels** (drop the three-way battery picker down to low / not-low).
  Simplest and matches actual current behavior honestly, but removes a UI affordance
  (medium) the user would need to re-approve removing, and doesn't give the user what the
  note seems to be asking for (a distinction, not a removal).
- **C. Leave as-is, revisit only once Energy is remounted somewhere.** Zero work now, but
  the complaint sits unresolved indefinitely with no trigger to reopen it.

**Question 2 — Sharing: what should the per-location explanation copy actually say?**
No location currently has this copy in either repo — confirmed by grepping `lib/i18n.ts` in
both repos for anything share-explanation-shaped; nothing exists to reuse or correct. The
consuming screens (`share-modal.tsx`, `shared.tsx`) are Phase 6, not yet built, so this is a
copy decision to bank now rather than a blocked one.

- **A. Draft the three strings now as a starting proposal** (e.g. shopping: "Makes a code so
  another phone can see and tick off this same list."; tasks: "Shares these tasks so another
  phone can see and complete them."; plans: "Shares today's plan so another phone can follow
  along.") — user edits/approves before Phase 6 needs them. Gives Phase 6 something concrete
  to consume immediately once it starts. *Recommended.*
- **B. Leave it TBD until Phase 6 actually builds the sharing screens**, draft copy in that
  session instead, in context of the real UI. No wasted effort if the wording changes once
  the screens exist, but reopens the exact same open question later instead of closing it
  now while it's cheap (per Decision 011a's OB-3 framing: "cheap to close").
- **C. User supplies the exact wording directly**, no draft proposed. Skips any risk of
  anchoring on a Claude-drafted phrasing the user didn't ask for.

## 2026-07-02 — Phase 4 answers: Decision 018 (Energy removed) + OB-3 deferred to Phase 6

**Status: Complete.** User answered both compiled questions from the entry above.

**Question 1 (Energy medium/high parity) — answered with a fourth option not offered:**
remove the Energy check-in feature entirely. Task intensity is now exactly the codebase's
existing two-value `importance` field (`'regular'`/`'essential'`), renamed to user-facing
**General**/**Essential** "modes," gated solely by Focus mode (Decision 009 (4) — already
fully specified, not re-decided here). Recorded as **Decision 018** in
REBUILD_DECISIONS.md, superseding Decision 009 (1)'s "stays in repo, unmounted" clause.
OB-2 marked resolved (removed, not refined).

**Code changes (same session, small/contained — direct execution of the user's decision,
no further ambiguity to compile into a question):**
- **Deleted** `components/EnergyCheckIn.tsx` and `store/useEnergyStore.ts` — confirmed via
  grep these had exactly one consumer relationship (component → stub store) and no other
  importers anywhere in the repo before removing.
- `lib/i18n.ts` — removed the now-orphaned `en.energy`/`no.energy` blocks (check-in prompt,
  low/medium/high, low-energy hint). Renamed `importanceRegular` ("Regular"/"Vanlig") →
  **"General"/"Generelt"** — reuses the exact word already sitting unused in this same file
  as `generalSectionLabel` (the old app's superseded Important/General two-section Plans
  stack, Decision 009a — not touched, still dead/unconsumed pending the real Plans build),
  so "General" isn't an invented term. `importanceLabel` ("Importance"/"Viktighet") →
  **"Mode"/"Modus"** to match. Neither key has a real consumer yet (task-form.tsx is
  Phase 6) — zero behavioral risk, confirmed by grep before renaming.
- `lib/db.ts` — corrected the file header's `Used by →` list (dropped the now-deleted
  `store/useEnergyStore.ts` entry — it never actually imported this file, being an
  in-memory Decision 015 stub, so this is a header-accuracy fix, not a functional change)
  and annotated the still-present `energy_logs` table in the `Data →` line as dead. The
  table itself (and its retention-pruning `DELETE` line) is **left in place, unused** —
  per AGENTS.md's standing "never drop/recreate tables" invariant, leaving harmless dead
  schema is the safe default over surgically stripping a table, even though nothing has
  shipped from this specific rebuild to a real device yet.
- `components/DayTimeline.tsx`'s `task.importance === 'essential'` star-marker rendering
  was checked and correctly left untouched — that's the separate "important tasks marked"
  visual cue (FEATURE_INVENTORY's Today's-plans section), not an energy-driven filter, so
  Decision 018 doesn't reach it.

**Question 2 (Sharing explanation copy) — answered "B":** defer to Phase 6. The sharing
screens (`share-modal.tsx`, `shared.tsx`) don't exist yet; copy will be drafted in that
session, in context of the real UI, rather than banked now. REBUILD_DECISIONS.md's OB-3
entry updated to record this choice — still open, no Decision entry, just a recorded
"when" instead of "now."

**Verification:** `npx tsc --noEmit` — 33 errors, identical count and file list to the
prior Phase 4 entry's run (confirmed via grep — zero hits for
`EnergyCheckIn|useEnergyStore|lib/i18n.ts|lib/db.ts` in the new output). No new errors from
either the deletions or the renames.

**Out of scope, unaffected:** `importantSectionLabel`/`generalSectionLabel` (old two-section
Plans stack labels, superseded by Decision 009a's rail day-view, still unconsumed pending
the real Plans build — not part of this decision). Focus mode's own construction (Decision
009 (4)) — still Home-phase work, not pulled forward here.

**Phase 4 complete** (both compiled questions answered; no further open items from the
FEATURE_INVENTORY sweep).

## 2026-07-02 — Planning: task "then" link (net-new feature, Decision 020)

**Status: Complete** — No code written. Planning session for a user-requested
feature: an intuitive way to chain tasks done in sequence (e.g. a morning
routine). Three shapes were explored — A (explicit multi-step list), B
(routine container object), C (soft one-to-one link) — user chose C for its
near-zero setup cost.

Resolved and filed as **Decision 020** (this entry collided on number twice
in flight — drafted as "Decision 018," rebased to "019" after `main`
independently filed a different Decision 018 in the interim, then rebased
again to 020 after `main` independently filed a different Decision 019 in
the interim; see the numbering note on Decision 020 itself): a task gets an
optional, one-to-one "then → this task" follower pointer, one-directional
(predecessor → follower), set inline from the task-edit affordance.
Completing the predecessor surfaces/highlights the follower in the day view;
it does **not** schedule a notification for it — both tasks keep their own
independent date, time, recurrence, and existing per-task notification
untouched. Schema: single nullable `follows_task_id` column on `tasks`
(verified against `lib/db.ts` — no prior task-to-task reference exists),
`ON DELETE SET NULL` so deleting the predecessor cleanly clears the
follower's link without deleting the follower.

Three sub-questions were explicitly left open for the build session rather
than guessed here: whether the link persists across weekly-recurrence
instances, whether cross-date surfacing pulls the follower into today's view
or only highlights it in place, and how the setup UI guards against an
A→B→A cycle. Per-follower notifications (a related but distinct user
comment) were explicitly flagged as out of scope for 020.

**Phase placement:** Phase 5 (stores) + Phase 6 (screens) — net-new
architecture, not a Phase 3 composite-card gate. Not buildable yet; recorded
now for traceability ahead of that work. See Decision 020 in
`REBUILD_DECISIONS.md` for full detail.

## 2026-07-02 — Planning: re-adding an already-listed shopping item (Decision 021)

**Status: Complete** — No code written. Planning-chat product question: what
happens when a user adds an item to a week list that's already there, from
either the week list itself or from the monthly catalog — three conceptual
states (already there / newly added / amount increased).

Resolved and filed as **Decision 021** (drafted as "Decision 018" in the
source planning session, per the same numbering precedent as 017/020 —
018/019/020 were each independently claimed by other sessions before this
landed). Reviewed the two old-repo (`All-the-small-things`) re-add paths and
found they disagree: `add()` increments the existing row's amount on a
matching weekly row, while `addToWeeklyFromCatalog()` overwrites the amount
and only matches `status='catalog'` rows (so it silently misses rows already
promoted to `inWeeklyList`). Resolved to unify on **increment** for both
paths — the overwrite behavior is a bug in the old repo, not a pattern to
port forward.

Feedback for the three states is **ephemeral only**: a brief highlight
("just added" / "amount increased") on the affected `ShoppingRow` that fades
out, with no persisted per-row status column and no new `ShoppingItem`
field. The highlight scope is explicitly limited to the same-item-re-added
case (matching status+listId+name+dishName) — the cross-dish standalone case
is out of scope here.

**Numbering gap flagged:** the source conversation referred to the cross-dish
case as "Decision 019," but that number was already independently claimed in
this repo by the unrelated task hint-note field. The cross-dish decision was
never actually filed here under any number — a future planning session needs
to file it fresh; see the numbering note on Decision 021 itself.

**Phase placement:** Phase 5 (store behavior) + Phase 6 (ShoppingRow
highlight) — `useShoppingStore.ts` is still the Phase 5 `notImplemented`
stub (Decision 015); not buildable yet, recorded now for traceability. See
Decision 021 in `REBUILD_DECISIONS.md` for full detail.

## 2026-07-02 — Documentation reconciliation (REBUILD_PLAN.md + REBUILD_DECISIONS.md numbering note)

**Status: Complete.** No app code touched — bookkeeping pass only, per this
session's explicit scope.

**Discrepancy found before editing (per this session's own gate) and
resolved with the user:** the session brief's canonical decision map listed
the cross-dish standalone shopping-item case as UNFILED. Reading
REBUILD_DECISIONS.md in full first (as instructed) showed this was stale —
**Decision 022** ("Drag-to-merge a standalone item into a dish group",
Resolved, 2026-07-02) already files and resolves that exact case, and
Decision 021's own "Pointer update" note already points to it. Stopped and
asked the user before editing; user chose to treat 022 as part of the
canonical map and proceed with all three tasks on that basis.

**REBUILD_PLAN.md (Task 1 — Phase 3 3c/3d text):**
- Removed the "Sequencing correction … Run 3d before Session A2·1, not
  after" instruction and 3d's "Run before Session A2·1" note (both satisfied
  — Phase 3d logged done 2026-07-02, before Session A2·1 as planned).
  Replaced with past-tense landed-as-planned notes citing Decision 011 R1.
  3d now carries a ✅ DONE marker matching 3a/3e's existing style.
- Cleared the ⚠ marker on ShoppingRow (now ✅ DONE, citing Decision 011
  A2-2/R1/R2/R3 and the Session A2·1 port). WeekListCard already carried
  ✅ DONE — untouched beyond the surrounding sentence. PlanTaskCard's
  existing note (BUILD under Decision 009 Session B, not a 3c port) was
  already accurate — kept as-is. Cleared the heading-level ⚠ on the 3c
  bullet itself (batch-uniform-port warning), now stale since the whole
  batch resolved and landed.
- Left the existing "Phase 3 complete" summary line untouched, as
  instructed.

**REBUILD_PLAN.md (Task 2 — Phase 5/6 forward-reference list):** added a
list under the Phase 6 screen breakdown naming Decisions 019 (hint field),
020 (then-link), 021 (re-add increment), and — per the corrected map — 022
(drag-to-merge, resolves 021's cross-dish carve-out) with their Phase 5
store / Phase 6 presentational split, plus OB-3 (still open, deferred to
Phase 6 per the Phase 4 answer).

**REBUILD_DECISIONS.md (Task 3 — reconciliation note):** appended a new
"## Numbering reconciliation (2026-07-02)" section at the bottom of the
file (no existing entry edited). States the canonical 016–022 map, clarifies
Decision 019's internal "Decision 018" self-references mean Decision 020,
and states plainly that the cross-dish case is filed as Decision 022 (not
unfiled), consolidating the collision notes previously scattered across
019/020/021/022 into one lookup point.

**Not touched:** no design decision was opened, resolved, or re-litigated;
no app code, component, store, or screen was touched, per this session's
explicit scope.

## 2026-07-02 — Phase 5: real useTaskStore + task-form.tsx (Decisions 018/019/020)

**Status: Complete.** Replaced the Decision 015 `notImplemented` stub with the real,
SQLite-backed `useTaskStore` and ported `app/task-form.tsx` against it — the first
real store + paired screen in this repo (every other `store/*.ts` is still a Decision
015 stub). Read `REBUILD_DECISIONS.md` and `PROGRESS_LOG.md` in full, plus the old
`All-the-small-things` repo's `store/useTaskStore.ts`, `app/task-form.tsx`, `lib/db.ts`,
`lib/date.ts`, `lib/dataAccess.ts` before writing anything, per this session's own
instructions.

**Decision 020 sub-questions — asked, not guessed (per this session's explicit STOP
instruction):**
1. **(a) Recurrence persistence — answered "yes, it's on the task definition."**
   Matches the leaning already recorded in Decision 020: `follows_task_id` lives on
   the same single row a recurring task already uses for every generated occurrence
   (this schema never materializes per-occurrence rows), so the link persists across
   recurrence instances by construction — no extra schema or code needed.
2. **(b) Cross-date surfacing — answered "pull the follower into today's view"**
   (a bigger commitment than the leaning recorded in Decision 020, which favored
   "highlight in place only"). This is explicitly Home-phase day-view work, out of
   this session's scope (schema + form-level setup affordance only) — **not built
   here**. Flagging for whichever session builds the Home/day-view follower surfacing:
   the user's answer supersedes Decision 020's own leaning on this point, so build
   toward "pull into today's view," not "highlight in place."
3. **(c) Cycle guard — answered "walk the chain live, disable looping tasks in the
   picker"** (the recommended option). Implemented as `useTaskStore.followerCycleChain(id)`
   (walks `followsTaskId` backward from `id`, self included) — `task-form.tsx`'s
   follower picker excludes every id in `followerCycleChain(existing.id)` from its
   candidate list, so a cycle can never be selected in the first place (not caught
   after the fact on save).

**Schema (`lib/db.ts` migrations array, append-only, two new lines):**
- `tasks.hint TEXT DEFAULT ''` (Decision 019) — freeform "next time" note, display-only.
- `tasks.follows_task_id TEXT DEFAULT NULL` (Decision 020) — lives on the **follower**
  row, pointing at its predecessor's id (`t.followsTaskId === predecessorId` means "t
  follows predecessor"). SQLite can't `ALTER TABLE` to add a real `FOREIGN KEY` to an
  existing table, so `ON DELETE SET NULL` is enforced in application code instead:
  `useTaskStore.remove()` clears any row's `follows_task_id` that pointed at the
  deleted task, in the same `tx()` transaction as the delete. Documented as a header
  gotcha in `lib/db.ts` so a future raw-delete call site doesn't reintroduce an orphan.

**`store/useTaskStore.ts` (full real port):**
- `Task`/`TaskInput` are the old app's shape plus `hint: string` and
  `followsTaskId: string | null`. `TaskInput.hint`/`followsTaskId` are optional so
  existing callers (`QuickAddSheet.tsx`, which never set either) keep compiling
  unchanged — `add()` defaults them to `''`/`null`.
- Ported via `lib/dataAccess.ts`'s `loadFirst`/`loadAll`/`updateRow`/`insertRow` +
  `FieldMap` pattern (CLAUDE.md constraint 6) — `load`, `add`, `update`, `toggle`,
  `completeDirect`, `remove`, `clearAll`, `tasksForDate`, `backlogTasks`,
  `completedCount`, `focusTask`, `reorderTasks`, and the full `task_steps` CRUD
  (`addStep`/`removeStep`/`toggleStep`/`reorderStep`, immediate-persist, no
  draft/save gate) are all faithful ports of the old store's logic.
- **`followsTaskId` is deliberately excluded from `TASK_COLUMNS`** (the FieldMap used
  by `add()`/`update()`) and from `update()`'s patch type
  (`Partial<Omit<Task, 'id' | 'followsTaskId'>>`) — the only legal way to change it is
  the new `setFollower(predecessorId, followerId)` action, since a follower change can
  touch a SECOND row (clearing whoever previously followed the same predecessor, to
  keep the 1:1 invariant both directions). Both statements run inside one `tx()`.
- **Not ported (flagged, not silently dropped): per-task notification scheduling and
  the `'task_completed'` automation trigger.** The old store's `syncTaskNotification`
  (via `lib/notifications.ts`/`lib/taskNotifications.ts`) and
  `useAutomationStore.fireTrigger()` calls were dropped because none of those three
  files exist in this repo yet (confirmed via `ls` before writing — `lib/` has no
  `notifications.ts`/`taskNotifications.ts`, `store/` has no `useAutomationStore.ts`).
  This mirrors Decision 016's own phase split ("Store + notifications phase" is
  explicitly a separate future phase from "Form phase") rather than pulling that work
  forward out of sequence. `syncAllTaskNotifications()` was dropped from the store's
  public API entirely for the same reason (nothing calls it yet either).
- Ported `lib/id.ts` (`generateId()`) verbatim — needed for SQLite TEXT primary keys
  and didn't exist in this repo yet (every other store is still a stub, so nothing had
  needed it before now).

**`app/task-form.tsx` (new file, Decision 001 tier='sub' scaffold):**
- Mounts via `ScreenScaffold` (back link left, iOS-only; Save `checkmark` icon in the
  right action slot — plain `Pressable`+`Ionicons`, matching `ScreenHeader`'s own
  24px icon rhythm for that slot, not a new pattern).
- All text inputs/toggles/segmented choices go through `FormControls`
  (`Input`/`Switch`/`SegmentedControl`/`Checkbox`) per this session's instruction;
  structural pickers (week-day chips, duration chips, the calendar toggle, the
  "then" candidate list) stay bespoke `Pressable` rows, matching how every other
  ported screen in this repo already treats chip/grid pickers vs. generic inputs.
  `DatePickerCalendar` (already ported, Phase 3d) is reused for the full-month
  fallback; the Mon–Sun week-chip row is hand-rolled, same structure as the old app.
  Time/Type fields are grouped in one `<Surface>` card, same as the old app's
  `timeTypeGroup`.
- **No `TimePickerWheel`** — that component was never ported into this repo (outside
  Phase 3d's scope). Time entry uses a plain `FormControls.Input` (HH:MM text) instead
  of porting a new bottom-sheet wheel component, per this session's own "use
  FormControls for all inputs" instruction.
- **Decision 018 (Energy removed):** Mode field is a two-option `SegmentedControl`
  (General/Essential, the existing `importance` field) — no energy/battery picker,
  matches the decision exactly.
- **Decision 019 (hint):** one `FormControls.Input` (multiline), label/placeholder from
  the two new i18n keys below. Included in the same Save payload as every other field
  — no separate write path, since it's a plain display-only note.
- **Decision 020 (then link):** gated on `existing` (same precedent as the Steps
  section — a predecessor needs an id to link a follower to). Shows the current
  follower's title (looked up by reverse-scanning `tasks` for whoever's
  `followsTaskId === existing.id`, since the pointer lives on the *follower's* row,
  not `existing`'s own) with a remove `IconButton`, or a "+ Pick a task" button that
  expands a candidate list excluding `followerCycleChain(existing.id)`. Picking a
  candidate calls `setFollower()` immediately (same immediate-persist pattern as
  Steps) — not gated behind the main Save button.
- Per-type accent colouring (old app's `FeatureColors.task`/`FeatureColors.shared` on
  the Type segmented control) was **not ported** — Decision 006's 8 feature-accent
  tokens don't include a "shared" equivalent, and inventing a new token mapping here
  would be exactly the kind of silent color decision CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md forbid. The
  Type field is now a plain `SegmentedControl` like every other segmented choice in
  the form (single accent, no per-option colour) — flagged here as a deliberate
  simplification, not an oversight.
- Save/delete/confirmation-banner flow, `confirmationMessage()`, and
  `confirmDelete()`/`performDelete()` are faithful ports of the old app's logic and
  timing (~900ms delay before `router.back()`).

**i18n (`lib/i18n.ts`, both `en`/`no`):** confirmed nearly every task-form string
already existed from earlier phases (the file's own header already listed
`app/task-form.tsx` as a future consumer). Added only what Decision 019/020 needed:
`taskHintLabel`, `taskHintPlaceholder`, `thenTaskLabel`, `thenTaskNone`,
`thenTaskPick`, `thenTaskChange`, `thenTaskRemove`, `thenTaskEmptyList`. (`thenLabel`
already existed but under the unrelated `automations` IFTTT namespace — new keys were
named `thenTask*` to avoid colliding with it.)

**Header updates (AGENTS.md "update headers as you go"):** `DayTimeline.tsx`,
`NextTaskCard.tsx`, `QuickAddSheet.tsx` each had a stale "Phase 5 stub / Decision 015"
note about `useTaskStore` — corrected to reflect the real store now existing.
`DraggableTaskRow.tsx` checked and confirmed it doesn't reference `useTaskStore`/`Task`
directly, so no change needed there.

**Verification:** fresh `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` (no `node_modules` in this
container) + `npx tsc --noEmit` — 35 errors, **zero** touching any file this session
created or changed (confirmed by grepping the output for
`task-form|useTaskStore|lib/id\.ts|lib/db\.ts|lib/i18n\.ts|DayTimeline|NextTaskCard|
QuickAddSheet|DraggableTaskRow` — no hits). The 35 are the same known pre-existing
family from every prior session's own run: missing `expo-blur`/`expo-linear-gradient`/
`react-native-svg`, old-token-name errors in `app/_layout.tsx`, `app/_scaffold-demo.tsx`,
`app/index.tsx`, `BottomNav.tsx`, `ScreenHeader.tsx` (including its already-flagged
stray `Platform`-from-`'react'` import bug), `ScreenBackground.tsx`, `ScreenScaffold.tsx`,
`Surface.tsx`'s one `theme.white` line, and `app/shopping.tsx`'s pre-existing
`t.moreOptions` gap. None touched or introduced by this session — left exactly as
prior sessions found them, per the same "not this session's scope" precedent used
throughout this log.

**Unresolved / flagged for future sessions:**
- **Decision 020 (b)'s answer supersedes its own recorded leaning** ("pull the
  follower into today's view" vs. the decision's "highlight in place" leaning) — the
  Home/day-view phase that builds actual follower surfacing must build toward the
  user's answer here, not Decision 020's original text. Worth a formal decision-log
  update when that phase starts, so the leaning text doesn't mislead a cold read.
- Notification scheduling (`lib/notifications.ts`, `lib/taskNotifications.ts`) and
  `store/useAutomationStore.ts` still don't exist in this repo — whichever session
  ports them next must wire `syncTaskNotification`/`fireTrigger('task_completed')`
  back into `useTaskStore.ts`'s `add`/`update`/`toggle`/`completeDirect` (flagged
  in-file, in the store's own header Edit notes).
- `app/task-form.tsx` isn't linked from anywhere yet (no "+" affordance, no Plans row
  tap-through) — same "ported ahead of its caller" precedent as every other Phase 3/5
  component so far; wiring it up is Home/Plans-phase work.
- `app/shopping.tsx`'s pre-existing `t.moreOptions` gap (flagged in the Phase 3e/4
  entries above) is still open — not touched, out of this session's scope.

## 2026-07-02 — Phase 5/6: real useHabitStore + habit-form.tsx + habit notifications (Decision 016)

**Status: Complete.** Second real store + paired screen in this repo (after `useTaskStore`/
`task-form.tsx`). Read `REBUILD_DECISIONS.md` and `PROGRESS_LOG.md` in full, plus the old
`All-the-small-things` repo's `store/useHabitStore.ts`, `lib/habitNotifications.ts`,
`lib/notifications.ts`, `lib/taskNotifications.ts`, `lib/db.ts`, `app/habit-form.tsx` before
writing anything, per this session's own instructions.

**Dependency gate checked first:** the task-store phase (`store/useTaskStore.ts` +
`app/task-form.tsx`, Decisions 018/019/020) is logged complete immediately above — real
`dataAccess.ts` usage and migration precedent are both established there. Gate met, proceeded.
Note: unlike the brief's framing, there was no Decision 015 `useHabitStore` stub to replace —
`store/` had no `useHabitStore.ts` at all (Decision 015 only declared stubs for the six Phase 3b
sheets' stores). Built the real store fresh, same shape as if a stub had existed.

**Schema (`lib/db.ts` migrations array, append-only, five new nullable columns):**
- Decision 016 Q3 (3B-ii) — `habits.reminder_mode TEXT`, `reminder_count INTEGER`,
  `reminder_interval_min INTEGER`, `reminder_start TEXT`, `reminder_end TEXT`. Editing
  metadata only; `notification_times` (already migrated in an earlier session) stays the sole
  authoritative source for scheduling — these are never read back into it.
- Decision 016 Q2 — the base `habits` table's `notification_time` column (already part of the
  original `CREATE TABLE`, predates this session) is now formally dead: the real store neither
  reads nor writes it. Documented in `lib/db.ts`'s header (same "kept per never-drop-columns,
  same precedent as `energy_logs`" framing already used there for the dead energy table).

**`lib/notifications.ts` (new file, ported in full):** the old app's low-level
expo-notifications primitives layer. Habit reminders only need
`scheduleDailyReminder`/`cancelDailyReminder`/`isWithinQuietHours` from it, but the file is a
single self-contained module with zero SQLite/store coupling (confirmed via its own header:
"Data → schedules OS notifications (no SQLite/store)") — splitting out a habit-only slice would
fork it from the identical file a future task-notifications phase needs verbatim. Applied the
same "port the foundational file whole, ahead of every consumer" precedent already used twice
in this repo for `lib/date.ts` and `lib/id.ts`, rather than either option the brief offered
literally (minimal slice, or stop-and-flag) — flagging the substitution here per the brief's own
"port the minimum needed and note it" instruction. Everything task/weekly/monthly/
persistent-notification/re-nudge-related in the file is inert (no store calls it yet), same
"ported ahead of its consumer" pattern as every other Phase 3/5 file so far. `expo-notifications`
was already in `package.json` (no new native dependency, no APK build needed).
**`lib/taskNotifications.ts` was explicitly NOT ported** — nothing in habit scope needs it
(`lib/habitNotifications.ts` never imported it, even in the old app); task-reminder wiring
stays its own future phase per Decision 016's own phase split, exactly as the brief scoped it.

**`lib/habitNotifications.ts` (new file, ported + Decision 016 Q4 quiet-hours wiring):**
- `syncHabitReminder(habit, settings)` now takes a `HabitNotifSettings` subset (mirrors
  `useTaskStore`'s existing `TaskNotifSettings` pattern) instead of separate
  language/enabled args, so `quietHoursEnabled`/`quietHoursStart`/`quietHoursEnd` come along
  the same way.
- **Skip-inside-window, not shift (Decision 016 Q4):** each candidate occurrence is checked
  against `isWithinQuietHours(hour, minute, start, end)` before scheduling; an occurrence
  inside the window is simply never scheduled for that slot (everything was already cancelled
  via `cancelHabitReminders()` at the top of the function, so "skip" requires no extra code —
  just not calling `scheduleDailyReminder` for that index). `pushPastQuietHours` (the task-side
  shift behaviour) is deliberately not imported here, matching the decision's explicit
  "habits skip, tasks shift" split.
- **Decision 016 Q2 — dropped the legacy single-time fallback.** Old code fell back to
  `habit.notificationTime` when `notificationTimes` was empty; the new `Habit` type has no
  `notificationTime` field at all, so this fallback has nothing to read — `notificationTimes`
  is unconditionally the only source, empty ⇒ no reminders scheduled.

**`store/useHabitStore.ts` (full real port):**
- Ported via the same `lib/dataAccess.ts` `loadAll`/`insertRow`/`updateRow` + `FieldMap`
  pattern used by `useTaskStore`/every other real store (CLAUDE.md constraint 6) — `load`,
  `add`, `update`, `remove`, `reorder`, `increment`, `decrement`, `markRestDay`,
  `syncAllHabitReminders` are faithful ports of the old store's logic, unchanged apart from the
  reminder fields below.
- **`Habit` type has no `notificationTime` field** (Decision 016 Q2) — `notificationTimes:
  string[]` is the only reminder-time field. Added `reminderMode: HabitReminderMode | null`,
  `reminderCount: number | null`, `reminderIntervalMin: number | null`, `reminderStart: string
  | null`, `reminderEnd: string | null` (Decision 016 Q3) to both the type and `HABIT_COLUMNS`
  (identity `to`, since string|null/number|null already match `SQLValue`). `rowToHabit` reads
  the two nullable-integer columns via a direct `row[col] == null ? null : Number(...)` check
  (no shared `readNullableInt` added to `lib/dataAccess.ts` for two call sites — inlined,
  matching the "don't over-abstract for a handful of uses" instruction) and the nullable-string
  columns via the same `readStr(...) || null` idiom `useTaskStore.ts` already established for
  `followsTaskId`.
- `syncHabitReminder()` (module-private, schedules on `add`/`update`) now builds a full
  `HabitNotifSettings` object from `useSettingsStore.getState()` (adding
  `quietHoursEnabled`/`quietHoursStart`/`quietHoursEnd` to the existing
  `habitNotificationsEnabled`/`language` reads) instead of the old two-arg call.
- `HabitReminderMode = 'single' | 'count' | 'interval'` now lives in the store (exported) rather
  than as a form-local type, since it's a persisted column's type, not just UI state —
  `app/habit-form.tsx` imports it from here.

**`app/habit-form.tsx` (new file, Decision 001 tier='sub' scaffold):**
- Mounts via `ScreenScaffold` (back link left, iOS-only; Save `checkmark` icon right action —
  same plain `Pressable`+`Ionicons` pattern `task-form.tsx` already established for that slot).
- FormControls throughout: `SegmentedControl` for kind (build/break) and the three reminder
  modes (old app hand-rolled both as chip rows — converged onto the shared primitive, matching
  this session's explicit instruction); `Input` for title, the four cue→craving→response→reward
  fields, and every HH:MM time field; `Switch` for the notification toggle (old app used a raw
  RN `Switch` with hardcoded `Colors.orange`/`Colors.white` — replaced). No FormControls
  stepper primitive exists in this repo, so the daily-goal and reminder-count steppers stay
  hand-rolled `Pressable` +/- pairs, restyled to Decision 006 tokens (same precedent
  `task-form.tsx` set for its duration/day chips, which also have no FormControls equivalent).
- **No TimePickerWheel** (never ported into this repo, Phase 3d's scope didn't include it,
  same situation `task-form.tsx` already documented) — every time field (single-mode time,
  reminder-window start/end) is a plain `FormControls.Input` (HH:MM text), per this session's
  own "use FormControls for all inputs" instruction.
- **Decision 016 Q1 (port as-is):** the three-mode picker (Once/Several times/Every…), window
  pickers, count stepper (2–12), interval chips (30/60/90/120/180/240, floor 15 enforced in
  `computeReminderTimes`), and live preview line are all present, unchanged in behavior from
  the old form — `computeReminderTimes()` ported verbatim (byte-for-byte logic, including the
  inverted-window-collapses-to-single-at-start default, Decision 016 Q5).
- **Decision 016 Q2 (drop mirror):** no `notificationTime` field or write anywhere in this
  file — `save()`'s payload only ever sets `notificationTimes`.
- **Decision 016 Q3 (recipe columns, round-trip fix):** `save()` persists `reminderMode` plus
  whichever of `reminderCount`/`reminderIntervalMin`/`reminderStart`/`reminderEnd` are relevant
  to the current mode (others explicitly `null`); all five are `null` when notifications are
  off. The initial form state prefers `existing.reminderMode` when present and only falls back
  to the old app's length-based inference (`notificationTimes.length > 1 ? 'count' : 'single'`)
  for a habit saved before this session (or while notifications are off) — so a habit created
  via "Every 2 h" now reopens in "Every…" mode instead of silently becoming "Several times".
- Essentials-first layout preserved from the old form: Kind → Title → (For, if child profiles
  exist) → Notification are always visible; icon, category, the four steps, daily goal, and the
  (now effectively decorative, since only 'daily' is offered) recurrence picker stay behind the
  existing `t.habits.moreOptions`/`fewerOptions` disclosure, open by default in edit mode when
  any advanced field already holds a value — unchanged from the old app's own default-open rule.
- Delete is confirm-gated via `showAppModal`, reusing `t.resetConfirmTitle`/`resetConfirmBody`/
  `resetConfirmBtn` — matches the old habit-form's own (slightly unusual) choice to reuse the
  "reset" copy family for this confirmation rather than "delete"; not changed, since re-wording
  it wasn't asked for and old copy already exists in both languages.
- **No ConfirmationBanner / no post-save delay** — unlike `task-form.tsx`, which added a
  ~900ms-delayed confirmation banner as a deliberate enhancement for that screen, the old
  habit-form just calls `add`/`update` then `router.back()` immediately with no banner. Kept
  that plain behavior rather than importing `task-form.tsx`'s embellishment un-asked-for.

**i18n (`lib/i18n.ts`, both `en`/`no`):** confirmed nearly every habit-form string already
existed from an earlier phase (all of `habitFormTitle`/`habitFormEdit`/`habitKindBuild`/
`habitReminderMode*`/`habitReminderCountLabel`/`habitReminderIntervalLabel`/
`habitReminderStart/EndLabel`/`habitReminderEveryHours`/`Minutes`/`habitReminderTimesPreview`/
`habitCategories`/`habits.moreOptions`/`fewerOptions`/etc. were all already present — checked
before adding anything, per token policy). Added only one new key pair:
`hints.habitForm.{text,example}` (the `HintCard` at the top of the form — no hint existed for
this specific screen; `hints.habits` already existed but is the *habits list* screen's hint, a
different consumer).

**Header updates (AGENTS.md "update headers as you go"):** `lib/db.ts`'s header gained an edit
note documenting `notification_time` as dead and the five new recipe columns as scheduling-inert
metadata. `components/HabitIcon.tsx`'s "Used by" line updated — it now has a real consumer
(`app/habit-form.tsx`) instead of being a leaf ahead of all three of its listed screens.
`store/useSettingsStore.ts` and `lib/i18n.ts` already forward-declared `store/useHabitStore.ts`/
`app/habit-form.tsx` as consumers in their headers from an earlier phase — no change needed there.

**Verification:** fresh `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` (no `node_modules` in this container) +
`npx tsc --noEmit` — 35 errors, **zero** touching any file this session created or changed
(confirmed by grepping the output for `habit-form|useHabitStore|habitNotifications|lib/
notifications|lib/db\.ts|lib/i18n\.ts|HabitIcon` — no hits). Same count and same known
pre-existing family as the immediately-prior task-store session's own run (missing `expo-blur`/
`expo-linear-gradient`/`react-native-svg`, old-token-name screens, `ScreenHeader.tsx`'s stray
`Platform` import, `app/shopping.tsx`'s pre-existing `t.moreOptions` gap). None touched or
introduced by this session.

**Unresolved / flagged for future sessions:**
- `app/habit-form.tsx` isn't linked from anywhere yet (no habits-list "+" affordance) — same
  "ported ahead of its caller" precedent as every other Phase 3/5/6 screen so far; wiring it up
  is the `app/habits.tsx` screen's own future phase.
- The settings-phase quiet-hours hint copy update (Decision 016 Q4 — "Task reminders wait until
  quiet hours end…" needs to cover habits too, and reflect skip-not-wait for habits) is still
  open — explicitly scoped to the settings phase in Decision 016, not touched here.
- The settings-phase "merged Plan notifications toggle vs. separate habit toggle" question
  (Decision 016's own "Adjacent finding") is still open — not decided or touched here.
- `app/habits.tsx`, `app/health.tsx`'s inline habits sub-section, and `app/settings.tsx`'s
  habit-notification/quiet-hours UI are all still unported — `store/useSettingsStore.ts`'s
  header already forward-lists them as future consumers.

---

## 2026-07-02 — Phase 5: catalog + shopping stores (real ports) + inventory-edit.tsx

**Scope:** Ported the real `useCatalogStore` and `useShoppingStore` (replacing their
Decision 015 stubs) plus `app/inventory-edit.tsx` — the last self-contained form. This
is the Phase 5 "port each store alongside the smallest screen that uses it" step:
inventory-edit is the smallest screen consuming `useShoppingStore` (it reads only the
`status === 'catalog'` inventory slice). Verification: `npm install --legacy-peer-deps`
+ `npx tsc --noEmit` → **33 errors, zero touching any file this session created or
changed** (grep-confirmed clean for `useCatalogStore|useShoppingStore|inventory-edit|
catalogSeed`). The 33 are the same known pre-existing family every recent session reports
(missing `expo-blur`/`expo-linear-gradient`/`react-native-svg`; old-token screens
`_scaffold-demo`/`index`/`BottomNav`; `ScreenHeader.tsx`'s stray `Platform` import;
`app/shopping.tsx`'s `t.moreOptions` gap; `_layout.tsx`'s StatusBar/`cream`). No live-app
run is possible in this environment (no device/Expo host); typecheck + clean compile of
all downstream consumers is the available verification.

**`lib/catalogSeed.ts` (new file):** copied verbatim from the old repo (`CATALOG_SEED`,
~230 Norwegian grocery seeds). Header already names `store/useCatalogStore.ts` as its
sole consumer. Needed because `useCatalogStore.load()` seeds `store_items` from it and
the new repo hadn't carried it over yet.

**`store/useCatalogStore.ts` (real port):** faithful port of the old store — `load()`
(seeds on every call via stable `cat_<name>` IDs + `INSERT OR IGNORE`, keeps `price_source
= 'seed'` rows synced), `suggest(query, limit)`, `recordPurchases(purchases, receiptId?)`
(append-only `purchase_log`, price only ever rises, `receipt_id` link), `resetItemPrice`.
- **Decision 015a contract satisfied and widened, not narrowed:** the stub declared
  `suggest(name, limit?) => { id; name; price }[]`. The real `suggest` returns full
  `StoreItem[]` (`id/name/category/store/price`); the two consumers (`AddItemSheet`,
  `AddDishSheet`) read only `id/name/price`, so the stub shape is a structural subset —
  both compile unchanged (confirmed: neither appears in the tsc output).
- No `useReceiptStore` dependency in this repo — `recordPurchases`'s `receiptId` just
  writes `purchase_log.receipt_id` (column exists, migration already present). All
  `store_items`/`purchase_log` columns it writes (`price_source`, `last_updated`,
  `receipt_id`) already exist in `lib/db.ts` — no migration added.

**`store/useShoppingStore.ts` (real port, reconciled to the stub contract):** ported the
old 613-line store's logic, but the EXPORTED types/signatures are reconciled to the
Decision 015 stub every already-ported consumer (`app/shopping.tsx` + 8 components)
compiles against, so nothing downstream churned:
- **`MonthlyResetSummary.inventoryItems/adHocItems` are `ShoppingItem[]`** (the purchased
  rows themselves, chronologically sorted) — matching `MonthlyResetSummaryModal`'s
  existing expectation. The old app's projected `MonthlyResetSummaryItem[]` +
  `generatedAt` shape was dropped (nothing in this repo read them; the modal reads
  `id/name/price/purchasedAt`, all on `ShoppingItem`).
- **`update()` keeps the broad `Partial<Omit<ShoppingItem,'id'>>` signature** the store's
  own internals require (they patch `amount`/`status`/`checked`/…). The stub's narrow
  `{name,price,targetQuantity,isTemporary}` patch is a subset, so external callers still
  typecheck; broadening a param type never breaks callers passing less.
- **Legacy old-only columns** (`listType`/`store`/`monthlyAllocated`/`monthlySourceId`/
  `weekKey`) stay on `ShoppingItem` as optional/legacy fields (additive — breaks no
  consumer) so `rowToItem`/`ITEM_COLUMNS`/`removeWithSource`'s allocation-release path
  keep working against the existing schema. `status` is exported as `ShoppingStatus`
  (richer than the stub's `string`, still comparison-compatible everywhere).
- **Schema:** every column the store reads/writes already exists in `lib/db.ts`
  (`shopping_items` status/order_index/list_id/from_catalog/collected/target_quantity/…,
  `shopping_trips` incl. the `list_id` ALTER at migration ~391). **No migration added**,
  no `CREATE TABLE` touched — consistent with the never-drop/recreate invariant.
- **`getState()`** comes for free from Zustand's `create` (the stub hand-rolled it);
  `app/shopping.tsx`'s `useShoppingStore.getState().load()` keeps working.

**Decisions applied by the shopping-store port (both were flagged in REBUILD_PLAN as
Phase-5 store behaviour landing here):**
- **Decision 021 (re-add increments, no overwrite):** `addToWeeklyFromCatalog` no longer
  ports the old `amount: String(Math.max(1, quantity))` OVERWRITE line verbatim (the
  decision explicitly forbids that). It now checks for a matching `inWeeklyList` row
  (same name+dishName+listId) in the target list first: if found, it INCREMENTS that
  row's amount by `quantity` and leaves the standing `catalog` row intact; otherwise it
  flips the catalog row in place with `amount = quantity` (first add). This brings the
  path in line with `add()`'s increment semantics. The ephemeral ShoppingRow "just
  added / amount increased" highlight is Decision 021's Phase-6 presentational half —
  NOT built here (no schema/store state for it, per the decision).
- **Decision 022 (drag-to-merge into a dish group):** added the new `mergeItems(sourceId,
  targetId)` store action — sums the two rows' amounts into the target (dish) row,
  which keeps its own `dishName`/group membership, then deletes the source. This is the
  decision's Phase-5 store-action obligation. The same-name drop gate + drag hit-testing
  are the future shopping-row drag session's Phase-6 concern (Decision 011 R1 mechanism)
  and are deliberately NOT wired here — `mergeItems` currently has no caller, exactly as
  Decision 022's "Unblocks: nothing yet buildable this session" anticipates.

**`app/inventory-edit.tsx` (ported against the real store + new components):**
- Decision 001 `tier='sub'` scaffold: mounts via `ScreenScaffold` (back link left,
  iOS-only; no bottom block), replacing the old `SafeAreaView` + `ScreenHeader bordered`.
- Ported against the NEW component prop shapes (all theme-internal now — no `theme`
  prop): `MonthlyTableRow(item,onTogglePending,onPress,temporaryLabel)`,
  `UpdateSheet(visible,item,onClose,onSave,onDelete)`,
  `AddItemSheet(visible,origin,onClose,onAdd)`, `EmptyState(title=…)` (old `text` prop
  renamed), `AddFAB(onPress,bottom)`.
- The `<Modal>`-based sheets + the absolutely-positioned `AddFAB` render as **siblings**
  of `ScreenScaffold` (its children live inside an internal `ScrollView`) — same overlay
  pattern `app/shopping.tsx` documents for its `ConfirmationBanner`.
- `AddItemSheet`'s `onAdd` now yields an extra `alsoAddToCatalog` flag (only meaningful
  for `origin='weekly'`); ignored here since this screen always adds `status:'catalog'`.
- Decision 006 tokens only: `theme.surface` (was `theme.white`), `theme.border` (was
  `theme.grayLight`).
- Route auto-registers via Expo Router file-based routing — `app/_layout.tsx` uses a
  bare `<Stack>` with no explicit `<Stack.Screen>` entries, so no registration edit.
- **No `HintCard`** — the old inventory-edit had none, and Decision 010 leaves HintCard
  reach a per-screen merit call; this orphaned utility screen doesn't warrant one.

**Header updates (AGENTS.md "update headers as you go"):** rewrote both store headers
from their stub text to the real Connections/Data/Edit-notes; `lib/catalogSeed.ts`'s
header (copied) already lists the correct consumer. `lib/db.ts`'s `Used by →` already
listed both stores (they were stubs that never actually imported it — now they do, so the
forward-reference is realised, no edit needed).

**Unresolved / flagged for future sessions:**
- **Startup `load()` wiring is still deferred to the `_layout` bootstrap phase.** Neither
  store self-loads, and no screen calls `load()` on mount — same established precedent as
  `task-form`/`useTaskStore` and every other ported store so far. Until the `_layout`
  phase wires `useShoppingStore.getState().load()` / `useCatalogStore.getState().load()`
  at startup, `inventory-edit` (and shopping autocomplete) render empty. `app/shopping.tsx`
  already documents that its automatic recurring-list-advance + payday monthly-reset
  effects are the same deferred `_layout`/Phase-5-follow-up work.
- **`resetWeekly` was NOT ported** — it belonged to the retired `list_type='weekly'` bulk
  delete and has no consumer in the new status-model repo (the stub never declared it).
  Left out deliberately; flag if a future weekly-clear affordance needs it.
- Decision 021's ShoppingRow highlight and Decision 022's drag wiring remain Phase-6
  presentational work (see above) — the store side is done.

## 2026-07-02 — Phase 5: Shopping-list store real port + shopping-screen persistence wiring

**Status: Complete.** Ported the last remaining Decision 015 stub in the shopping
stack (`useShoppingListStore`) to a real SQLite-backed store, and wired the
mount-time hydration/advance/reset calls `app/shopping.tsx` previously omitted, so
the screen now actually persists. `useShoppingStore` was already the real Phase-5
port (prior commit `b28514c`, verified this session — Decisions 021 & 022 correct).

**Preconditions verified before coding:** Decisions 006, 011, 011a/R4, 015/015a,
017, 021, 022 all present as real structured entries; `shopping_lists` table + all
columns exist in `lib/db.ts` (incl. `locked` migration, line 393); `lib/date.ts`
exports `todayStr`/`dateStr`/`getWeekRangeContaining`/`formatDateRange`; settings
store has `weeklyResetDay`/`language`/`monthlyResetDate`/`lastMonthlyReset`;
`lib/i18n.ts` has `monthsShort` (en+no); `lib/id.generateId` + `getTranslations`
present. No unrecorded decision hit — did not stop-and-flag.

**Ported `store/useShoppingListStore.ts` (stub → real):**
- Verbatim port of the old-app store logic (multiple named/recurring/template
  weekly lists over `shopping_lists`): `load` (+ `backfillOrphanedItems`
  self-heal), `add`, `update`, `remove`, `rename`, `setRecurring`, `toggleLocked`,
  `currentList`, `advanceRecurringLists` (closed-form period jump + `copyOpenItemsToList`),
  `saveAsTemplate`, `instantiateTemplate`.
- Exported `ShoppingList` **widens** the stub shape (adds
  `isCustomName`/`sortOrder`/`createdAt`, makes `recurrenceIntervalWeeks` required).
  Verified no consumer constructs a `ShoppingList` literal — `WeekListCard`,
  `ListSettingsSheet`, `SavedListsModal`, `app/shopping.tsx` all only read it as a
  prop type — so the widening is additive and no consumer churns. The stub's
  `add(range)→void` / `currentList→{id}` are subsumed by the real
  `add(ShoppingListAddInput)→string` / `currentList→ShoppingList|undefined`.

**`app/shopping.tsx` mount-time wiring (scope item 5):** replaced the cleanup-only
`useFocusEffect` with a full on-focus effect that:
1. Initialises the DB once per app session (idempotent `initDb()`, guarded by a
   module-level `dbBootstrapped` flag). The app still has **no global bootstrap** —
   `_layout.tsx` is the Phase-1 scaffold and calls neither `initDb()` nor any store
   `load()` — so the first screen needing persistence bootstraps it. Flagged below.
2. Hydrates settings → shopping → list stores (settings first: the list store's
   default-name/week-range helpers read `weeklyResetDay`+`language`).
3. Runs `advanceRecurringLists(today)` then re-runs `loadShopping()` (advance writes
   `shopping_items` rows directly via the list store, so items need a refresh).
4. Performs the automatic payday-boundary monthly reset: reads settings via
   `getState()` (fresh, post-`loadSettings()`), and when `lastMonthlyReset`'s
   YYYY-MM ≠ this period **and** today's day-of-month ≥ `monthlyResetDate`, calls
   `buildMonthlyResetSummary()` **before** `monthlyReset()`, then persists
   `lastMonthlyReset: today`. Matches the old app's logic exactly.
   Still closes both add sheets on blur (unchanged rationale).
- Updated the screen header's stale "no store action from a mount-time effect"
  note and `useShoppingStore`'s "load not wired yet" header line to reflect reality.

**Decision confirmations (no code needed — already correct from prior commit):**
- **021 (re-add increment parity):** `add()` and `addToWeeklyFromCatalog()` both
  increment a matching `inWeeklyList` row instead of overwriting; the old
  `addToWeeklyFromCatalog` overwrite line was NOT ported. ✔
- **022 (store action):** `mergeItems(sourceId, targetId)` sums amounts into the
  target (dish) row and deletes the source, so the merged row keeps the target's
  `dishName`/group. ✔
- **011a/R4 (dish checkbox roll-up/down):** `toggleDish()` bulk-toggles via the real
  `toggleCheck` (check-all-if-not-all-checked / uncheck-all-if-all-checked);
  `computeListGroups()` includes checked items in dish groups so the derived
  `dishGroupAllChecked()` roll-up is observable. ✔

**Verification:** `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` then `npx tsc --noEmit` → 33 errors,
**identical to the standing baseline** (old-token screens `_layout`/`_scaffold-demo`/
`index`/`BottomNav`/`ScreenHeader`/`ScreenBackground`/`ScreenScaffold`/`Surface`, missing
native libs, `StatusBar.barStyle`, and the pre-existing `app/shopping.tsx` `moreOptions`
i18n gap present in HEAD before this session). The new `useShoppingListStore.ts` and the
shopping.tsx effect added **zero** new errors.

**Unresolved / flagged:**
- **Decision 022 drag-to-merge UI wiring is NOT done — deliberately, and it is not
  cleanly doable under this session's "no new gesture infra" constraint.** The store
  action is ready, but a standalone item (`dishName: undefined`, in the
  ungrouped-unchecked section) and a dish ingredient (in a dish group) are in
  **different sections**. The existing Phase-4 drag surface only measures/hit-tests the
  single ungrouped-unchecked "Shopping list" section within one list — dish-group rows
  render `ShoppingRow` directly and are **not** drop targets. Wiring a same-name
  cross-section drop → `mergeItems` requires extending hit-testing to dish rows, which
  is new drag infrastructure and belongs to the incomplete A2·1 shopping-row drag
  redesign (STOPPED, see 2026-07-01 entry). Did not invent it here. `mergeItems` is
  callable and correct the moment that surface exists.
- **Decision 021 ShoppingRow "just added / amount increased" highlight** remains Phase-6
  presentational (local component state, no schema) — store side done.
- **No global app bootstrap yet.** `initDb()` + settings/store `load()` now run from
  `app/shopping.tsx`'s focus effect (self-contained, guarded). A future `_layout`
  bootstrap phase should hoist `initDb()` + startup store loads app-wide so screens
  other than shopping also persist; at that point the shopping-screen guard becomes a
  redundant (harmless) safety net.

## 2026-07-02 — Decision 009 Session B: PlanTaskCard day-view BUILD + app/plans.tsx + follower/hint surfacing

**Status: Complete.** BUILT the rail-based day-view (Decisions 009 / 009a / 009b), NOT a
port of the old two-section drag stack. Read `REBUILD_DECISIONS.md` (009/009a/009b/014/018/
019/020 + numbering reconciliation), `PROGRESS_LOG.md`, and both CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md in full;
read old `All-the-small-things` `app/plans.tsx` + `components/PlanTaskCard.tsx` for reference
only (confirmed OLD two-section system — deliberately not ported), plus this repo's
`DayTimeline`, `NextTaskCard`, `ExpandableCard`, `Surface`, `useTaskStore`.

**Dependency gate — MET (checked first, per prompt):** the Phase 5 real `useTaskStore` +
`task-form.tsx` (Decisions 018/019/020) is logged complete above, including the Decision 020
`follows_task_id` column and `setFollower`/`followerCycleChain`. Session 1 also already
ANSWERED Decision 020 open sub-question (b) — "pull the follower into today's view" (supersedes
Decision 020's own "highlight in place" leaning). So no STOP/ASK was needed; built toward the
recorded answer.

**`components/PlanTaskCard.tsx` (new — the day-view, replaces the old meaning of this name):**
Per Decision 009a "the Home preview IS the day-view, rendered read-only" — this is a single
component, one `<Surface>` card, that both the full `/plans` screen (interactive) and the Home
preview (`readOnly`) render. It is NOT the old accordion-per-task card and does NOT wrap
`ExpandableCard` (009a's redesign supersedes Decision 009 #2's "PlanTaskCard wraps
ExpandableCard" reference — the collapsed day-view still shows content, which ExpandableCard's
hide-all-body accordion shape can't express; noted in ExpandableCard's header).
- **Proportional rail (Option C):** connector height between two consecutive timed tasks =
  real gap minutes × `PX_PER_MIN` (0.55), clamped `MIN_GAP`(14)…`MAX_GAP`(72). Distance ∝ time
  without a long empty afternoon pushing the card off-screen. Anytime (untimed) tasks have no
  rail position — plain dotted rows above the timed rail (same as DayTimeline).
- **Collapsed = current + next + 2 after (4 rows):** the current/in-progress task always leads
  (`nextTimedIndex`), then next+2; overdue-but-pending timed tasks before "current" collapse
  away. "Show full day / Show less" toggle appears only when pending overflows the window and
  not in readOnly.
- **Gap state:** no task happening now but one coming → dashed marker "Nothing until HH:MM"
  (`t.dayViewGapUntil`) leading, next task follows.
- **Live now marker:** re-renders on 60s interval; inserted into the connector whose
  time-window contains `now`, or the task dot fills accent when happening-now.
- **Dimmed Done zone:** collapsed by default with its own chevron, `t.dayViewDoneZone(n)` count;
  expands in place. All-done day shows gentle `t.dayViewAllDone`, empty day shows
  `t.timelineEmpty`.
- **Rail tail (Decision 009b):** `railTailMinutes()` = 10% of visible span (first timed start →
  last unfinished end), floored at 15 min (the 009b-sanctioned execution guard, since on-device
  measurement isn't available in this env — started from pure 10%). Rendered as a trailing
  connector stub, `clamp(_, 10, MAX_GAP)` px.
- **Decision 020 follower surfacing (surfacing-only):** for each DONE task, its pending follower
  (`follower.followsTaskId === done.id`) is highlighted (3px accent dot ring + a "Then"
  `t.dayViewFollowerBadge` chip) AND pulled into today's view even across dates — pass
  `allTasks` (full store) so cross-date followers resolve. No notification, no scheduling.
- **Decision 019 hint:** the task considered "up" (current or next) shows its `hint` under the
  title (bulb icon, italic, display-only) — the reminder appears exactly when it's useful.
- **Decision 014 accent bar:** card face is `<Surface surfaceContext="ambient">`; a 4px left
  accent BAR (tinted `theme.featPlan`) is the only accent — no Surface border/sheen/fill tint,
  matching the 008/014 contract.
- **readOnly (Home preview):** disables done-toggle + row tap-through ONLY; structure, rail,
  collapse, done zone identical (009a "one component, one behavior"). Optional `onSeeMore`
  renders a "See everything →" (`t.seeEverythingLink`) link routing to the full screen.
- Haptics via `lib/haptics` (`success` on complete, `tap` on collapse/done toggles).

**`app/plans.tsx` (new — full Plans screen):** site-tier `ScreenScaffold` (BottomNav + header
chrome), `HintCard`, the interactive `PlanTaskCard` (today's tasks + `allTasks` for cross-date
followers), and an `AddFAB`. Rows tap through to `/task-form?id=…` (this also becomes the first
real caller of the ported-ahead `task-form.tsx`); the dot checks off inline via `toggle()`; the
FAB pushes `/task-form` for a new task. Loads settings + tasks on `useFocusEffect` (idempotent
`initDb()` guarded by a module flag, same pattern as `shopping.tsx`). No Focus mode here — Focus
mode is Home-only (Decisions 009 #4 / 018).

**i18n (`lib/i18n.ts`, both en/no):** added `dayViewGapUntil(time)`, `dayViewDoneZone(n)`,
`dayViewAllDone`, `dayViewFollowerBadge`. Reused existing `plansTitle`, `plansExpand`,
`plansCollapse`, `timelineEmpty`, `timelineNow`, `seeEverythingLink`, `hints.plans.text`.

**Headers updated (AGENTS.md "update as you go"):** `useTaskStore.ts` Used-by (added
`PlanTaskCard.tsx` + `app/plans.tsx`); `ExpandableCard.tsx` (corrected the speculative
"PlanTaskCard wraps ExpandableCard" note to record the 009a redesign divergence).

**Home day-view preview alignment:** delivered as the `readOnly` capability on the single shared
component (the alignment mechanism per 009a), NOT by assembling the Home screen — Home assembly
is explicitly out of Session B scope (Decision 009 Session-B scoping). Home will mount
`<PlanTaskCard readOnly onSeeMore=… />` in the Home phase; the component is ready for it.

**Scope boundaries honored:** did NOT touch Notes/Shopping previews, Focus mode, or Home
assembly. Left `components/DayTimeline.tsx` in place (still a valid agenda-strip component;
`plans.tsx` uses `PlanTaskCard`, not `DayTimeline`).

**Verification:** no remote toolchain (`node_modules` absent; `tsc` local-only per CLAUDE.md,
Jest not required). Manual review only, per repo policy: matched existing `DayTimeline`/
`ExpandableCard`/`NextTaskCard` idioms (token names, `useScaledStyles`, `useNowMinutes`,
Surface `cardRow`+accent pattern) so no new token/API surface was invented. All new i18n keys
added to both `en` and `no` (TS infers the dictionary type from `en`; `no` mirrors it).

**Flagged for the Home phase (not built here):**
- Mount `<PlanTaskCard readOnly allTasks={tasks} onSeeMore={→ /plans} />` inside the Home Plans
  preview slot; gate with Focus mode per Decisions 009 #4 / 018.
- A formal decision-log update is still worth filing so Decision 020's "highlight in place"
  leaning text doesn't mislead a cold read now that sub-question (b) resolved to "pull into
  today's view" (already flagged by Session 1; restated here since this session built to it).

## 2026-07-03 — Phase 6: single-purpose screens (capture, notes, share-modal, shared) + their stores

**Status: Complete (code + typecheck); OB-3 copy STILL OPEN — surfaced, not invented.**
Ported the Phase 6 single-purpose screens named in the brief — `app/capture.tsx`,
`app/notes.tsx`, `app/share-modal.tsx` — plus `app/shared.tsx` (share-modal's Done
target, explicitly in the brief's scope item 2), and the three real stores they need
(Phase 5 pairing rule): `useInboxStore`, `useNotesStore`, `useSharedStore` (all replaced
their Decision 015 stubs). Also ported `lib/share.ts` (QR payload encode/decode) as a
foundation gap-fill dependency of share-modal. `useFeedbackStore` was NOT ported — it's
the debug-overlay store, not consumed by any of these four screens.

**Preconditions verified before coding:** REBUILD_DECISIONS.md (012, OB-3, 006/008/014,
015/015a), PROGRESS_LOG, both CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md read. All four DB tables already exist
in `lib/db.ts` (`inbox_items`, `notes`, `shared_tasks`, `shared_shopping_items`) with
schemas matching the old stores' reads — **no migration added** (never-drop/recreate
invariant honoured). All component deps present in this repo (QRCodeDisplay, Surface,
Button, ScreenScaffold, HintCard, NoteRow, AddFAB, ShoppingQuickAddSheet,
ConfirmationBanner).

**Stores (real ports, replacing stubs):**
- `useInboxStore` — verbatim logic from old app; `promoteToTask(id, taskFields: TaskInput)`
  keeps the existing consumer contract (InboxSection already compiles against `TaskInput`,
  which is this repo's `add()` param — the old `Omit<Task,'id'|'steps'>` shape is the same
  thing here). Owns `inbox_items`.
- `useNotesStore` — verbatim; `Note` widened over the stub (adds `sortOrder`/`createdAt`) —
  additive, so `NoteRow` (reads only id/header/body/checked) still compiles. Owns `notes`,
  `load()` orders by `checked, sort_order` so the active/checked split falls out of array
  order.
- `useSharedStore` — verbatim in/out shared tasks + shopping; widened over the stub (adds
  `sourceTaskId`/`sourceItemId`/`date`/`createdAt` + `load`/`addSharedTasks`/
  `addSharedShopping`) — additive, so `SharedRequestsSection` keeps compiling. Owns
  `shared_tasks` + `shared_shopping_items`.

**Screens (Decision 001 scaffold + Decision 006 tokens + useT() throughout):**
- `capture.tsx` — tier='sub' ScreenScaffold; big multiline capture TextInput (hand-rolled,
  restyled to tokens — `FormControls.Input` is not a forwardRef and capture needs the input
  ref for stay-open/refocus, same "unlabelled textarea stays hand-rolled" precedent as
  QuickAddSheet/NoteRow); `Button` primitive for Capture/Save; `ConfirmationBanner` sibling
  overlay. Dual-mode add/edit via `?id=` preserved (Decision 012 edit affordance target).
- `notes.tsx` — tier='site' ScreenScaffold (owns BottomNav + header; old SiteSwipeView/
  BottomNav/ScreenHeader dropped, same as plans.tsx). NoteRow (no `theme` prop),
  active/checked split + accent divider (`theme.orange`→`theme.accent`), HintCard, AddFAB +
  ShoppingQuickAddSheet siblings. NO BottomNav tab added (Decision 012 / C1 — intentional).
  Loads notes+settings on focus (guarded initDb).
- `share-modal.tsx` — tier='sub' ScreenScaffold; Surface cards, `Button` for Share, QR
  result via QRCodeDisplay; hand-rolled circular selection checkbox restyled to
  accent/accentInk (multi-line label+sub row, checkbox precedent). `dismissAll()+push('/shared')`
  Done flow preserved. Token remap: orange→accent, greenLight/green→goodSoft/good,
  textLight→textMuted, Colors.white→accentInk.
- `shared.tsx` — tier='site' ScreenScaffold; tab switcher inlined as first (non-sticky)
  content row (old fixed-tab bar; scaffold owns chrome). Inline SharedShoppingRow/
  SharedTaskRow helpers now read `useAppTheme()` internally (dropped the retired
  `theme: AppColors` prop, same precedent as every other port). Loads shared+tasks+shopping
  on focus so cross-store mirrors stay fresh.

**i18n:** every visible string already existed in both `en`/`no` (inbox.*, notes.*,
share*/shared* families) — **no new keys added** for the faithful port (checked before
adding anything, per token policy).

**OB-3 (per-location share explanation copy) — STILL OPEN, surfaced not invented.**
The brief required stopping to enumerate the real share locations before drafting copy.
The built UI exposes these share points:
  1. Shopping screen → Share → `/share-modal?kind=s` (shares unchecked shopping items)
  2. Plans screen + Home screen → Share → `/share-modal?kind=t` (shares future undone tasks)
  3. Post-share QR screen already shows existing `shareInstructions`; `/shared` is the
     sent/received history landing.
I asked the user (placement + drafted copy) via AskUserQuestion, but the tool's permission
stream closed before an answer could be collected, so per "do not invent the copy silently"
the port ships with ONLY the existing `shareInstructions` string and OB-3 remains open. The
proposed drafts I surfaced for when the user returns:
  - Per-kind line under the modal's selection-card title (recommended placement):
    Shopping — "Pick items to send as a QR code — the other person scans it to add them to
    their own list."  Plans — "Pick tasks to send as a QR code — the other person scans it
    to add them to their own plans."
Wiring is a ~1 i18n-key-pair + one `<Text>` change once the user picks placement/wording.

**Verification:** `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` + `npx tsc --noEmit` → 33 errors,
**zero in any file this session created or changed** (grep-confirmed clean for
capture/notes/share-modal/shared/useInboxStore/useNotesStore/useSharedStore/lib/share).
The 33 are the identical standing baseline every recent session reports (old-token screens
`_scaffold-demo`/`index`/`BottomNav`/`ScreenBackground`/`ScreenScaffold`/`Surface`/
`ScreenHeader`/`_layout`, `GradientSwatch`/`HomeHeroBackground` native-lib gaps,
`app/shopping.tsx` moreOptions/StatusBar). None introduced here.

**Header updates:** new files carry full Connections/Data/Edit-notes headers;
`QRCodeDisplay.tsx` "Used by" note updated (share-modal now ported, was "not ported yet").

**Unresolved / flagged for future sessions:**
- OB-3 copy (above) — waiting on user placement/wording decision.
- No global bootstrap yet — each screen self-loads its stores on focus (guarded initDb),
  same deferred `_layout` bootstrap precedent as shopping/plans.
- Share-modal entry points on Home/Plans aren't wired in the rebuild yet (those screens'
  own future phases); share-modal is reachable by route/kind regardless.

### 2026-07-03 addendum — OB-3 resolved (Decision 023)

User approved the per-kind in-modal explanation line. On wiring, found the OB-3 copy
was already pre-seeded bilingually in `lib/i18n.ts` (`shareExplainShopping`/
`shareExplainTasks`/`shareExplainLaterBuild`, EN+NO) — same meaning as the approved
drafts plus a "one-time copy for now, live sync later" caveat. Reused those keys rather
than overwrite bilingual copy with English-only drafts. Wired a `<Text>` under the
selection-card title in `share-modal.tsx` (picks the string by `kind`, appends the caveat).
Filed **Decision 023**, marked OB-3 resolved. No new i18n keys. Typecheck: 33 baseline
errors, zero in changed files.

## 2026-07-03 — Phase 6: mid-complexity screens (habits, meals, health) + paired stores

**Status: Complete.** Ported the three Phase 6 mid-complexity screens — `app/habits.tsx`,
`app/meals.tsx`, `app/health.tsx` — plus their paired stores: real `useMealStore` (replacing
the Decision 015 typed-interface stub) and a new real `useHealthStore`. Read
REBUILD_DECISIONS.md, PROGRESS_LOG.md, CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md in full, and the old
`All-the-small-things` sources (three screens + `useMealStore`/`useHealthStore` + `lib/db.ts`)
before writing.

**Dependency gate — MET (checked first):** the Phase 5/6 real `useHabitStore` +
`habit-form.tsx` + habit notifications (Decision 016) is logged complete above (2026-07-02).
`store/useHabitStore.ts` is a full real port exposing `habits`/`logs`/`increment`/`decrement`/
`markRestDay` and the `Habit`/`HabitLog` types the habits + health screens consume. No STOP/ASK
needed for the gate.

**Decision 024 filed + resolved via user (three functional-colour calls).** All three legacy
screens relied on `constants/theme.ts` functional colours / raw-hex ramps that Decision 006's
token layer has no equivalent for — an unrecorded decision, so stopped and asked before
building. User answers (all "recommended"): (Q1) habit build/break = token map (build→`good`,
break→`featTask`, partial→`accent`, empty→`border`, rest→`textMuted`); (Q2) health severity
keeps the fixed purple→blue 5-step hex ramp as a documented Decision-006 data-viz exception,
with fixed paired inks; (Q3) meal tiles use the single `featMeal` accent (drop per-type hues),
"Surprise me" uses primary `accent`. Full detail in Decision 024.

**Decision 014 consequence (health severity affordance) — resolved by inspection, not a design
call.** The old `health.tsx` never used `accentColor` for severity; it renders severity as a
labelled, colour-filled `leadingAction` badge on each log's ExpandableCard (which even
documents `leadingAction` as "e.g. a severity badge"). So the 4px-accent-bar reduction from
Decision 014 never applied here — the labelled leading badge is the explicit affordance and is
kept as-is. No `Badge` added.

**Stores:**
- `store/useHealthStore.ts` (new, full real port) — `health_logs` table via `lib/dataAccess`
  (`loadAll`/`insertRow`/`updateRow` + `FieldMap`), `log_date`↔`date` mapping, `add()` returns
  the created log (health screen seeds its lifted edit state from it). Table/index already
  existed in `lib/db.ts` — no migration needed.
- `store/useMealStore.ts` (real port replacing the Decision 015 stub) — `dishes` + `ingredients`
  tables, ingredients grouped onto dishes in one pass. Richer `Dish` (mealType,
  estimatedPriceNok, Ingredient.id/dishId) is a superset of the stub `AddDishSheet` consumed
  (it only reads name/id/ingredients{name,amount,unit}) — verified compatible. Tables +
  `estimated_price_nok` migration already existed in `lib/db.ts` — no new migration needed.

**Screens (all Decision 001 tier='site' via ScreenScaffold; useAppTheme + useScaledStyles;
Decision 006 tokens except the Decision 024 severity exception; load stores on focus):**
- `app/habits.tsx` — today/week/month views, build/break sections, streak/CompletionGlow/rest-day.
  Profile selector + view tabs now scroll at the top of the scaffold content (the old
  fixed-below-header placement isn't needed). Sub-component `theme` params typed `ThemePalette`.
  AddFAB sibling of the scaffold. HintCard added (`hints.habits` already existed).
- `app/meals.tsx` — category tiles → category dish list, hand-rolled new-dish modal (kept over
  AddDishSheet, which collects neither mealType nor estimated dish price). Dynamic scaffold
  title; in-content back/shuffle toolbar replaces the old ScreenHeader back/right slots. New-dish
  sheet wrapped in `<Surface surfaceContext="overlay">` (Decision 008). HintCard added.
- `app/health.tsx` — last-30-days overview + severity strip, per-log lifted-edit ExpandableCards,
  inline habits summary (+/- counts). ConfirmationBanner sibling of the scaffold. HintCard added.

**Nav / entry points:** `health` is a BottomNav tab (site tier correct). `habits` is reached
via health's inline "see all" (`router.push('/habits')`, preserved). **`meals` has no defined
entry point yet** — `lib/siteNav.ts` lists it as "removed from nav, route kept" but names no
access point. Ported ahead of its caller (same precedent as habit-form, notes, etc.); wiring a
Home/other entry for meals is a later navigation/Home-phase task — flagged, not invented here.

**i18n:** every string these screens use already existed in both `en`/`no` (habits.*,
severityLabels, mealTypes, dayLabels, hints.{habits,meals,health}, delete/confirm families,
etc.) — verified before writing; **zero new i18n keys added** (token-policy check).

**Header updates:** `store/useHabitStore.ts` and `components/HabitIcon.tsx` "Used by" lines
updated (habits.tsx / health.tsx are now real consumers, not "not yet ported"). New store
headers written for useHealthStore / useMealStore.

**Verification:** `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` + `npx tsc --noEmit` → **33 errors, zero
touching any file this session created or changed** (grep-confirmed clean for
`health.tsx|meals.tsx|habits.tsx|useMealStore|useHealthStore`). The 33 are the same known
pre-existing family every recent session reports (missing `expo-blur`/`expo-linear-gradient`/
`react-native-svg`; old-token screens `_scaffold-demo`/`index`/`BottomNav`/`ScreenHeader` incl.
its stray `Platform` import; `_layout.tsx`). None introduced by this session.

**Unresolved / flagged for future sessions:**
- `app/meals.tsx` entry point (see Nav above) — needs a Home/other surface to be reachable.
- `constants/theme.ts` legacy `green`/`neutral`/`MealColors`/`AppColors` are now dead for these
  screens (kept per never-delete precedent).
- `app/_layout.tsx` startup store-loading for useHealthStore/useMealStore not wired (screens
  load on focus, same as plans/notes) — a `_layout` startup-load pass is still a future task.

## 2026-07-03 — Phase 6: Home screen (app/index.tsx) — assembled with all three previews + Focus mode

**Status: Complete (code + typecheck).** Replaced the Phase-1 placeholder `app/index.tsx` with
the real Home hub: the three converged previews (Decision 009 #2), Focus mode (Decisions 009 #4
/ 018), and Decision 020 follower surfacing (via PlanTaskCard). Read REBUILD_DECISIONS.md
(006/008/009/009a/009b/014/018/020 + the 016–022 numbering reconciliation), PROGRESS_LOG.md,
CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md, and the old `All-the-small-things/app/index.tsx` (reference only) before
writing.

**Dependency gate — MET (checked first, per prompt):**
- Plans day-view (Session B / Decision 009a): `components/PlanTaskCard.tsx` logged complete
  (2026-07-02) with `readOnly`/`allTasks`/`onSeeMore` ready for exactly this mount.
- Task store (Session 1 / Phase 5): `store/useTaskStore.ts` real port logged complete
  (2026-07-02) — `tasksForDate`/`toggle`/`completedCount`/`importance`/`followsTaskId` present.
- Three preview composites: `InboxSection.tsx` (Phase 3e refactor), `WeekListCard.tsx` +
  `ShoppingRow.tsx` (A2·1/A2·2), `PlanTaskCard.tsx` (Session B) — all logged complete and
  present in `components/`. Gate satisfied; no STOP/ASK needed.

**What was built (`app/index.tsx`):** site-tier `ScreenScaffold isHome` (owns background,
particles, header chrome, BottomNav). Content: greeting + date, a daily-progress line, then the
three previews —
- **Notes preview = `<InboxSection/>`** (Decision 009 #2; self-contained; hidden in Focus mode).
- **Plans preview = `<PlanTaskCard/>`** (Decision 009a — the preview IS the day-view). Off-focus:
  `readOnly` + `onSeeMore → /plans`. In Focus mode: non-readOnly with `onToggleTask` wired but no
  `onPressTask`/`onSeeMore`, and `tasks` filtered to `importance === 'essential'` (Decision 018) —
  done-toggle stays live, tap-through/add do not (Decision 009 #4). `allTasks` (full store) is
  always passed so Decision 020 cross-date followers surface (surfacing logic lives in
  PlanTaskCard).
- **Shopping preview** = current week's list (`useShoppingListStore.currentList`) rendered through
  `ExpandableCard` + `ShoppingRow` (Decision 009 #2 / Session A convergence): dish groups (nested
  ExpandableCard), ungrouped-unchecked, and cart sections, with tick-to-buy / collect / stepper /
  catalog-vs-adhoc remove preserved. Reorder deliberately omitted (drag needs the parent screen's
  hit-testing per Decision 011 R1 — not a Home preview's job). Hidden in Focus mode.
- Gentle points (`smallThingsCount`) + `AddFAB` + `Pet` — all hidden in Focus mode (points/FAB are
  a preview/input; FAB explicitly per Decision 009 #4).

**Focus mode (Decisions 009 #4 / 018) — ephemeral, Home-only.** Implemented as local
`useState(false)`, NOT the persisted `essentialsModeEnabled` the old app used — reset to OFF in the
`useFocusEffect` cleanup so navigation-away and relaunch both return to unfocused (Decision 009 #4
"not persisted"). Wired the existing Decision 001a header-eye placeholder: added optional
`focusActive` + `onToggleFocus` props to `ScreenHeader` (filled `eye`/accent when active, else
`eye-outline`; a11y state) and threaded them through `ScreenScaffold`. Every other site screen omits
the props, so the eye stays the harmless no-op it already was there (Focus is Home-only). Not a new
decision — just executing 001a/009 #4/018.

**Deliberately NOT ported (deps superseded or absent — flagged, not silently dropped):**
- Old two-section DayTimeline/TaskItem/NextTaskCard Plans stack → superseded by PlanTaskCard (009a).
- Backlog + Habits Home previews → both rendered via `components/TaskItem.tsx`, which is **not
  ported into this repo** (only the day-view path was). Re-adding them needs a TaskItem port first.
- Separate Notes(`useNotesStore`) Home preview → folded into InboxSection by Decision 009 #2.
- `SharedRequestsSection(kind='task')` → the ported component supports only `kind='shopping'`
  (Phase 6 narrowed it); the task-kind Home mount has no component to call.
- Update-ready banner (`useUpdateStore` not ported); work-mode banner (`lib/holidays` /
  `lib/taskOrder.rankTodayTasks` not ported); CoverScreen / SiteSwipeView chrome.

**Scope item 4 — automation trigger (`shopping_opened`) NOT wired — flagged, not invented.**
There is **no automation store in this repo** (`store/useAutomationStore.ts` / automation libs were
never ported; `store/useTaskStore.ts`'s own header already flags the sibling `task_completed` gap).
Wiring `shopping_opened` would mean building an automation system from scratch — an unrecorded,
out-of-scope decision — so per the prompt's "any unrecorded decision → STOP and flag" it is left for
the future notifications/automation port. No stub store was created.

**No new decisions, no new i18n keys, no migrations.** Every visible string already existed in both
`en`/`no` (greeting/days/months/dailyOverview/shoppingPreview/shoppingEmpty/seeAll/seeEverythingLink/
inWeeklyListSection/inKurvenSection/ingredientsCount/inStockLabel/smallThingsCount/focusActive/
focusInactive/nav.home). Decision 006 tokens throughout (no raw hex): progress `good`, accent links
`accent`, shopping accent `featShop`, muted text `textMuted`, dividers `surfaceMuted`. Decision 014
honoured — `accentColor` on the shopping ExpandableCards is accent-bar-only.

**Files changed:** `app/index.tsx` (rewritten), `components/ScreenHeader.tsx` +
`components/ScreenScaffold.tsx` (added `focusActive`/`onToggleFocus` passthrough), and "Used by"
header updates on `InboxSection.tsx` / `PlanTaskCard.tsx` / `ShoppingRow.tsx` (Home is now a real
consumer).

**Verification:** `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` + `npx tsc --noEmit` → 27 errors, **zero in
`app/index.tsx`** and **zero new** from the ScreenHeader/ScreenScaffold edits (my additions use only
valid `ThemePalette` tokens — `accent`/`text`/`bg`). All 27 are the known standing baseline family
(old-token screens `_layout`/`_scaffold-demo`/`BottomNav`/`ScreenBackground`/`Surface`/`ScreenHeader`
`theme.orange`+stray `Platform` import/`ScreenScaffold` `theme.cream`; missing native libs
`expo-blur`/`expo-linear-gradient`/`react-native-svg`; `app/shopping.tsx` `moreOptions`). Manual
review only per repo policy (no device/Jest).

**Unresolved / flagged for future sessions:**
- `shopping_opened` / automation triggers — blocked on an automation-store port (above).
- Backlog + Habits Home previews — blocked on a `components/TaskItem.tsx` port; re-evaluate whether
  they belong on the converged Home once TaskItem exists.
- `SharedRequestsSection` task-kind Home surface — needs the component to regain `kind='task'`.
- `app/_layout.tsx` still has no global store bootstrap (Home self-loads on focus, guarded initDb —
  same precedent as plans/notes/shopping); a `_layout` startup-load pass remains a future task.
- **Cross-session note (resolved by merge with the parallel budget/scan/automations session,
  2026-07-03): `useAutomationStore` now exists** (`shopping_opened`/`task_completed` triggers wired
  in `app/shopping.tsx` / `store/useTaskStore.ts`). That session's own log entry confirms Home was
  explicitly left out ("`app/index.tsx` still owns no automation triggers — none defined there;
  nothing to wire") — consistent with this entry's flag above. Home mounts no automation trigger;
  none was scoped to it beyond the already-resolved `shopping_opened` (a shopping-screen concern).

## 2026-07-03 — Phase 6: budget / scan / automations screens + paired stores; scan & automation wiring

**Status: Complete (code + typecheck).** Ported the three remaining Phase 6 screens named in
the brief — `app/budget.tsx`, `app/scan.tsx`, `app/automations.tsx` — plus their paired stores
(`store/useReceiptStore.ts`, `store/useAutomationStore.ts`, both real ports, not stubs) and the
foundation gap-fill `lib/receipt.ts` (pure OCR text→items parser + Levenshtein/fuzzy-match).
`app/shared.tsx` (4th screen in the brief) was **already ported** in the 2026-07-03 capture/notes/
share-modal session with OB-3/Decision 023 resolved — no STOP/ASK needed; verified present and
left untouched.

**Preconditions read in full before coding:** REBUILD_DECISIONS.md (006/008/014, 015/015a, 024),
PROGRESS_LOG.md, both CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md; old `All-the-small-things` sources for each screen +
`useReceiptStore`/`useAutomationStore`/`receipt.ts` + `lib/db.ts`. All three DB tables already
exist in `lib/db.ts` (`receipts`, `ifttt_rules`, `purchase_log.receipt_id`) — **no migration added**
(never-drop invariant honoured).

**Decision 025 filed + resolved via user (two no-token-equivalent colour calls, same class as 024):**
(Q1) budget over-budget bar → `warn` token (gentle amber, no-shame rule; on-track stays `good`);
(Q2) scan QR-scanner modal → fixed dark camera chrome (`#000` bg + fixed white title/frame,
theme-independent, since `textInverse` flips dark in dark themes). Both user-confirmed recommended.

**Stores (real ports, verbatim logic against the new-repo lib APIs — dataAccess/id/db/i18n all present):**
- `useReceiptStore` — owns `receipts`; `addReceipt`/`totalForMonth`/`receiptsForMonth`/`months`/
  `receiptsByStore`. Consumed by budget.tsx + scan.tsx.
- `useAutomationStore` — owns `ifttt_rules`; two trigger types (`task_completed`/`shopping_opened`)
  × two action types (`show_message` via showAppModal / `add_shopping_item` via useShoppingStore.add).
  `fireTrigger()` is called by the trigger sites, not vice-versa.

**Screens (Decision 001 scaffold + Decision 006 tokens + useT() throughout):**
- `budget.tsx` — tier='sub' ScreenScaffold (back → Shopping). Month selector, spend-vs-budget bar
  (over → `warn`, on-track → `good`), receipts list, per-store breakdown, inline budget editor Modal
  (card via `<Surface surfaceContext="overlay">`). Added 7 budget i18n keys (both en/no): `olderMonth`,
  `newerMonth`, `editBudget`, `setBudget`, `perStore`, `editorTitle`, `monthlyBudgetLabel` — the old
  screen had these hardcoded in Norwegian, now routed through useT().
- `automations.tsx` — tier='sub' + AddFAB. RuleCard (Surface) with active Switch + delete; inline
  NewRuleForm (trigger/action chip rows + message/item input). Loads rules on focus (guarded initDb).
  i18n already complete (`automations.*` in both langs) — zero new keys.
- `scan.tsx` — tier='site' scaffold for idle/result/manual; transient 'scanning' mode is a bare
  centered SafeAreaView (`theme.bg`). Old ScreenHeader right-slot "Budget" link → in-content top link
  (site headers render Focus-mode on the right; meals.tsx in-content-toolbar precedent). Four-store
  write path (shopping + receipt + catalog.recordPurchases + shared) preserved; QR import + custom-store
  + category-picker modals as siblings. QR modal = fixed dark chrome (Decision 025). i18n already
  complete (32/32 scan keys in both langs) — zero new keys.

**Scope items 2 & 3 (brief) — WIRED:**
- (2) `app/shopping.tsx` "Shopping done!" receipt choices: Scan → `/scan?autoCapture=camera`,
  Upload → `/scan?autoCapture=library` (both commit the trip first); Skip commits + confirms in place.
  Added `useRouter`. Now that scan.tsx exists the real route is restored.
- (3) `shopping_opened` automation trigger re-wired in shopping.tsx (mount effect self-loads rules +
  guards initDb, then `fireTrigger('shopping_opened')`). Also wired the paired `task_completed` trigger
  in `store/useTaskStore.ts` (toggle-to-done + completeDirect call
  `useAutomationStore.getState().fireTrigger('task_completed')`), matching the old store — no circular
  import (useAutomationStore doesn't import useTaskStore). `app/index.tsx` (Home) still owns no automation
  triggers — none defined there; nothing to wire.

**Header updates (AGENTS.md "update as you go"):** new/ported files carry full Connections/Data/Edit-notes
headers; `useTaskStore.ts` header updated (Imports → +useAutomationStore, task_completed now WIRED, task
notifications still the one remaining unported side-effect); `app/shopping.tsx` header note updated
(scan route + shopping_opened now wired, no longer "dropped").

**Verification:** `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` + `npx tsc --noEmit` → **33 errors, zero in any file
this session created or changed** (grep-confirmed clean for budget/scan/automations/useReceiptStore/
useAutomationStore/lib/receipt/useTaskStore; shopping.tsx has only its 2 pre-existing `moreOptions`
baseline errors, none from the router/automation edits). The 33 are the standing baseline every recent
session reports (missing `expo-blur`/`expo-linear-gradient`/`react-native-svg`; old-token screens
`_layout`/`_scaffold-demo`/`index`/`BottomNav`/`ScreenHeader` incl. its stray `Platform` import/
`ScreenBackground`/`ScreenScaffold`/`Surface`; `shopping.tsx` moreOptions).

**Unresolved / flagged for future sessions:**
- No global bootstrap yet — budget/scan/automations self-load their stores on focus (guarded initDb),
  same deferred `_layout` bootstrap precedent as shopping/plans. A `_layout` startup-load pass
  (incl. useAutomationStore.load() so triggers fire app-wide, not only after visiting a screen that
  loaded them) is still a future task.
- Task per-task notification scheduling still unported (`lib/taskNotifications.ts` absent) — see
  useTaskStore header.

## 2026-07-03 — Phase 6 (final): Onboarding flow ported + deferred mounts wired

**Status: Complete (code + typecheck).** Ported all ten onboarding files —
`app/onboarding/{_layout,language,privacy,guided,index,step2,step3,step4,step5,step6}.tsx`
— the last screens in the rebuild. With this, **Phase 6 / the rebuild is complete**
except the one flagged item below (SiteSwipeView wiring).

**Preconditions read in full before coding:** REBUILD_DECISIONS.md (006/008/010/014),
PROGRESS_LOG.md tail, both CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md, REBUILD_PLAN.md onboarding phase, and
all ten old `All-the-small-things` onboarding sources.

**Token remap (Decision 006, all screens):** `theme.white`→`surface`, `theme.grayLight`→
`surfaceMuted` (icon badges, inactive dots, switch tracks) or `border` (dividers/switch
track-false), `theme.textLight`→`textMuted`, `theme.orange`→`accent`, `theme.orangeLight`→
`accentSoft`, `theme.gray`→`textMuted` (switch thumb-off), `theme.green`→`good`,
`FeatureColors.shop`→`theme.featShop`. Text/icon on the guided screen's accent-tinted
`<Surface tint={theme.accent}>` → `accentInk`. No raw hex in screen chrome (shadowColor via
Shadow.card token exempt; pet colour swatches are stored hex data values — petColor is a hex
string — with `accent`/`good` seeding the first two, flagged in step6's header).

**Structure:** onboarding keeps its bare `SafeAreaView` layout (it's pre-setup, no BottomNav/
header chrome — Decision 001 scaffold is for the 5 sites + sub-screens, not onboarding).
Consistent typography (FontSize/Fonts tokens), Spacing tokens throughout (no magic numbers),
`Button` component for every CTA, 6-dot progress row (steps 0–5) on index/step2–6.

**HintCard (Decision 010, per-screen call):** added to step2 (`tipWorkMode`) and step3
(`monthlyPaydayHint`) — the two genuine "tip" boxes, converted from inline tipBox Views to
`HintCard`. Gated on `showHints`, which `guided.goGuided()` sets true before the wizard, so
they render in the guided flow. The core reassurance boxes (`onboardingSettingsNote` on
index/step4) stay as always-visible `accentSoft` note boxes (not hidden by a hints toggle).

**TimePickerWheel (never ported) — step2 work-hours:** replaced with `FormControls.Input`
(HH:MM text), the exact precedent task-form.tsx / habit-form.tsx already set for time entry.
No new component pulled in.

**icon.png asset gap-fill:** `assets/icon.png` was absent in this repo (only bg-light/dark +
monochrome had been ported); copied it over from the old repo so the welcome-screen logo
(index.tsx) renders. Same per-phase asset-port precedent as Phase 1.

**Deferred mounts wired (Phase 3e flag):**
- **DebugOverlay** — mounted in `app/_layout.tsx`, gated `loaded && debugModeEnabled`
  (both now exist in `useSettingsStore`). The old DebugOverlay header note ("debugModeEnabled
  doesn't exist yet") is now stale — the gate is live.
- **Pet in step5/step6** — step5 is theme+handedness (SwatchPicker), step6 is pet naming and
  mounts `<Pet completedToday={0} />` inline in a fixed-height `position:'relative'` preview
  box (Pet's root is `position:'absolute'`). Building these two screens *is* the flagged
  wiring; both now render their respective leaf (SwatchPicker / Pet).
- **SiteSwipeView — NOT wired, flagged (unrecorded decision → stop-and-flag per constraints).**
  The component's own header contract says wrap each *site screen's* scrollable content and
  explicitly NOT modals/camera overlays; a single global `_layout` wrap contradicts that and
  risks gesture conflicts (ShoppingRow's swipe-to-remove reuses the same
  activeOffsetX/velocity thresholds). Per-screen wiring across the 5 nav sites is a
  cross-cutting change outside onboarding scope. Left for a dedicated follow-up; recommended
  approach is per-screen wraps (index/plans/shopping/health/scan), excluding scan's camera
  overlay per SiteSwipeView's edit note. (An AskUserQuestion to confirm scope failed to
  deliver — tool stream closed — so defaulted to the contract-safe defer.)

**app/_layout.tsx bootstrap (minimal, to make onboarding reachable):** added `initDb()` +
`useSettingsStore.load()` on mount and the onboarding redirect guard (`loaded &&
!setupComplete && segments[0]!=='onboarding' → /onboarding/language`), registered the
`onboarding` Stack.Screen (plus the other ported screens + the four modal presentations), and
mounted DebugOverlay. This is a faithful slice of the old `_layout` — NOT the full multi-store
notification bootstrap, which stays deferred (each screen self-loads on focus). Switched the
Stack `contentStyle` from the non-existent `theme.cream` to `theme.bg`, which also cleared
`_layout.tsx` from the tsc baseline.

**step6.finish() — unported notification deps dropped, flagged:** the old finish() called
`syncReminders()` (lib/reminders.ts) and `useTaskStore.syncAllTaskNotifications()` — neither
exists in this repo (weekly/monthly reminder + per-task notification scheduling still
unported, per prior Phase 6 flags). Kept `requestPermissions()` (which does exist) so the OS
prompt still fires; the two sync calls are omitted with a header note, not stubbed.

**No new decisions, no new i18n keys, no migrations.** Every visible string already existed in
both en/no (chooseLanguage*, onboarding.privacy.*, guided*/explore*, whatsYourName/name*/
welcome*/features/onboardingSettingsNote, workMode*/startWithWorkMode/canChangeAnytime/
autoActivateWorkHours/appSwitchesItself/workHours*/tipWorkMode, shoppingOnboarding*/
monthly*, notifications*/taskNotifications*/weeklyReminders*, theme*/themeNames/
settings.accessibility.leftHanded*, onboarding.step6.*/settings.pet.*, config.skipForNow,
previous/next/getStarted/finishBtn).

**Verification:** `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` + `npx tsc --noEmit` → 24 errors, **zero in
any of the 10 onboarding files or `app/_layout.tsx`** (grep-clean). All 24 are the standing
baseline family (`_scaffold-demo`, `BottomNav`, `ScreenBackground`, `ScreenHeader`,
`ScreenScaffold`, `Surface`, `GradientSwatch`/`HomeHeroBackground` native-lib types,
`shopping.tsx` moreOptions) — and this session actually shrank the baseline by clearing
`app/_layout.tsx`'s old `theme.cream` error. Manual review only per repo policy.

**Unresolved / flagged for future sessions:**
- **SiteSwipeView** wiring (above) — the one remaining deferred mount.
- **Settings screen** (`app/settings.tsx`) is NOT in this repo — the one remaining screen.
  Two carried-forward notes for whoever builds it: (1) the old settings screen MERGES task +
  habit notifications into a single toggle (Decision 016's flagged "keep merge or split?" —
  a settings-content decision, still open); (2) the quiet-hours hint copy needs updating —
  habits are now covered and habit occurrences inside quiet hours are *skipped* not deferred
  (Decision 016 Q4). DebugOverlay's own on/off toggle also lives on the (unbuilt) settings
  screen (`debugModeEnabled`).
- **Notification scheduling** (`lib/reminders.ts`, `useTaskStore.syncAllTaskNotifications`,
  per-task/weekly/monthly) still unported — step6.finish() and the `_layout` bootstrap both
  leave the scheduling calls out and only request permission.

## Session G — Decision 027: expanded-permission native build (config only)

**Scope:** `app.json`, `package.json`, `REBUILD_PLAN.md` (native prereqs §1–§3),
`REBUILD_DECISIONS.md` (Decision 027). No app/store/lib/component code touched — this is a
build-config session, not a feature port.

### Module selection (recorded per Decision 027's mandate to *select and record*, not assume)
| Feature area | Module selected | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Camera / receipt scan | `expo-camera` | unchanged |
| OCR | `@react-native-ml-kit/text-recognition` | unchanged, autolinked |
| Notifications | `expo-notifications` (+ `expo-background-task`/`expo-task-manager`) | unchanged |
| Photo / media read | `expo-image-picker` + `expo-media-library` | both keep their config plugins |
| Microphone / voice notes | **`expo-audio`** | Expo-recommended capture module; `expo-av` audio APIs deprecated. Matches the decision's expected "obvious choice" — no divergence to flag. |
| Android widgets | **`react-native-android-widget`** | Expo community standard; no first-party module. |
| iOS widgets + rich-notif NSE | **`@bacons/apple-targets`** | WidgetKit + Notification Service Extension targets; App Group `group.com.freyrnorpixel.unfocus`. |

### Pruned (Decision 027 Q1 — user "prune to the 027 list", + Q2 Session G call)
Removed module + permission(s) + usage string(s) for: `expo-location`, `expo-calendar`,
`expo-contacts`, `expo-sensors`, and (Session G call) `expo-speech-recognition`. Rationale
and re-add cost are in Decision 027 Q1/Q2. Kept generic Android `FOREGROUND_SERVICE` (maps
to persistent notifications) but dropped `FOREGROUND_SERVICE_LOCATION`; dropped `location`
from iOS `UIBackgroundModes` (kept `fetch`, `processing` for background tasks).

### app.json changes
- `plugins`: removed `expo-location`, `expo-calendar`, `expo-sensors`,
  `expo-speech-recognition`, `expo-contacts`; added `react-native-android-widget`,
  `@bacons/apple-targets`. Kept the `expo-media-library` plugin (photo read/save strings).
- `ios.entitlements`: added App Group `group.com.freyrnorpixel.unfocus`.
- `ios.infoPlist`: kept `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription` (reworded to honest voice-note copy),
  kept `NSPhotoLibraryAddUsageDescription`, added `NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription` (read);
  removed the two `NSLocation*`, `NSCalendarsUsageDescription`, `NSContactsUsageDescription`;
  `UIBackgroundModes` now `["fetch","processing"]`.
- `android.permissions`: now just `RECORD_AUDIO`, `FOREGROUND_SERVICE`.
- **All usage-description strings are honest and non-empty** (esp. `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription`).

### package.json changes
- Removed: `expo-calendar`, `expo-contacts`, `expo-location`, `expo-sensors`,
  `expo-speech-recognition`.
- Added: `@bacons/apple-targets` (`^0.4.0`), `react-native-android-widget` (`^0.16.0`).

### Flagged for build time (not done here — deliberate)
- **`runtimeVersion` stays `1.0.0`.** Bump to `1.1.0` (match `version`) only when the APK is
  actually built, or current installs get stranded on the preview OTA channel. See Decision 027.
- **Package versions are best-effort, not resolved.** No `npm install`/network build ran in
  this remote session. Run `npx expo install @bacons/apple-targets react-native-android-widget`
  at build time to pin SDK-56/RN-0.85-compatible versions before the first `expo prebuild`.
- **Widget/NSE target contents not implemented** — scaffolding only, per 027's scope boundary.

### Verification
Config-only change; no typecheck/build available in the remote env (per CLAUDE.md). Manual
review: `app.json` is valid JSON and internally consistent (every retained plugin has its dep;
every removed dep has its plugin/permission/string removed). AGENTS.md already documents the
native-build → new-APK flow, so no AGENTS.md edit needed beyond the REBUILD_PLAN §1–§3 rewrite.

---

## Session — Native build: dependency resolution + config validation + build prep (2026-07-03, branch claude/native-build-setup-k3sj99)

Executes Decision 027 (native build). GATE note: **Decision 026 does not exist** in
REBUILD_DECISIONS.md (numbering goes 025 → 027); user directed "proceed on 027 only" —
027 is self-contained (depends only on REBUILD_PLAN.md §1–§3). Decision 027 confirmed Resolved.

### Native deps added / resolved (`npm install --legacy-peer-deps` clean, 907 pkgs)
The prior config sweep (PR #30) left **best-effort, unresolved** version pins; two did not exist
on npm and broke `npm install`. Resolved against SDK 56's `bundledNativeModules.json` (offline —
the Expo API is blocked by the sandbox proxy, so `npx expo install` could not fetch the map):

| Module | Choice | Note |
|---|---|---|
| `react-native-svg` | `15.15.4` | **Added** — imported by ScreenBackground/GradientSwatch but was missing from package.json (would not build). SDK-56 pin. |
| `expo-blur` | `~56.0.3` | **Added** — imported by Surface (glass material); was missing from package.json. SDK-56 pin. |
| `expo-linear-gradient` | `~56.0.4` | **Added** — imported by HomeHeroBackground; was missing. SDK-56 pin. |
| `@bacons/apple-targets` | `^4.0.7` | **DIVERGENCE (flagged):** prior pin `^0.4.0` **does not exist on npm** (versions jump 0.2.1 → 3.0.0; latest 4.0.7). Corrected to latest, which is the current SDK-54+/RN-new-arch line. |
| `react-native-android-widget` | `^0.20.3` | **DIVERGENCE (flagged):** prior pin `^0.16.0` (exists but old); bumped to current `0.20.3` for RN 0.85 / new-arch compatibility. |

These 3 rendering libs are the "pre-approved adopted set" from the task; they carry **no config
plugin / no native permission** (autolink only), so no `app.json` change was needed for them.

### OCR library — IDENTIFIED (not guessed)
`@react-native-ml-kit/text-recognition` (`^2.0.0`), already in package.json and used by
`parseReceiptText` in `app/scan.tsx`. **On-device native module (Google ML Kit), NOT a cloud
call.** Backs Camera permission (receipt scan).

### app.json — config fixes needed for resolution
- `react-native-android-widget` was declared as a **bare string plugin**, which crashed
  `expo config` (`props.widgets` undefined). Changed to `["react-native-android-widget", { "widgets": [] }]`
  — empty widget list = plugin/native scaffolding only, no widget contents (per 027 scope boundary).
- No other permission/plugin edits: PR #30's pruned set was already correct.

### Permission set — resolved & verified against Decision 027 (each maps to a named feature)
`npx expo config` resolves cleanly (exit 0). Resolved native surface:
- **Camera** → `expo-camera` (`NSCameraUsageDescription` via plugin at prebuild; `CAMERA`) — receipt scan/OCR.
- **Notifications** → `expo-notifications` (+ `expo-task-manager`/`expo-background-task`, `FOREGROUND_SERVICE`) — reminders.
- **Photo library (read)** → `expo-image-picker` + `expo-media-library` (`NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription`; `READ_MEDIA_IMAGES` et al.) — receipt upload-from-gallery.
- **Microphone** → `expo-audio` (`NSMicrophoneUsageDescription` = "UnFocus uses the microphone so you can record voice notes."; `RECORD_AUDIO`, `MODIFY_AUDIO_SETTINGS`) — voice notes.
- **Widget entitlements** → App Group `group.com.freyrnorpixel.unfocus` + `react-native-android-widget` + `@bacons/apple-targets` (WidgetKit target) — home/lock-screen widgets (scaffolding only).
- **Rich / lock-screen notification** → `@bacons/apple-targets` (NSE target scaffolding) + `expo-notifications`; Android lockscreen visibility is JS-side (OTA).
- **Forbidden-permission audit:** resolved Android manifest contains **NO** notification-listener or accessibility-service permissions (grep-checked the resolved config). None declared.
- **Minor over-declaration (flagged, not blocking):** `expo-media-library` auto-adds `READ_MEDIA_VIDEO`, `READ_MEDIA_AUDIO`, `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` beyond the "receipt image read" intent. Module-default surface, not a forbidden permission; narrow later if desired (would need a new build). `NSPhotoLibraryAddUsageDescription` (photo *save*) likewise exceeds strict "read" — retained from PR #30.

### Code fix tied to adopting expo-linear-gradient (in scope: making the installed module usable)
`components/HomeHeroBackground.tsx`: (1) `import LinearGradient from 'expo-linear-gradient'`
(default) → `import { LinearGradient }` — SDK 56 exports it as a **named** export only; the
default import was a latent runtime bug. (2) `sky`/`ground` color arrays given `as const` so they
satisfy SDK 56's tuple-typed `colors` prop. File now typechecks clean.

### Typecheck — `npx tsc --noEmit`: 20 errors remain, ALL pre-existing & out of native scope
Every native-touched file (HomeHeroBackground, app.json config) is clean. The 20 remaining
errors are an **incomplete `ThemePalette` migration** (missing `orange`/`cream`/`white`/`textLight`/
`grayLight` in `_scaffold-demo`, `BottomNav`, `ScreenBackground`, `ScreenHeader`, `ScreenScaffold`,
`Surface`), a missing `moreOptions` i18n key (`app/shopping.tsx` ×2), and `ScreenHeader.tsx`
importing `Platform` from `'react'` instead of `'react-native'`. These are other sessions'
work-in-progress, do not touch native config, and do NOT block an EAS/Metro build (Metro does not
typecheck). **GATE DISCREPANCY: the "Sessions A–E typecheck-clean" precondition is not actually
met on this branch.** Flagged for the owning sessions.

### Item 3 (wire `permissionTests.ts` into settings debug placeholder) — BLOCKED / prerequisite missing
Neither `permissionTests.ts` **nor an `app/settings.tsx` screen** exists anywhere in the repo or
its git history (i18n's "Used by" lists `app/settings.tsx` as a port-ahead, but the file was never
created; the only debug surface that exists is `components/DebugOverlay.tsx`, a notes panel). There
is no "placeholder left by Session C" to wire into. Not fabricated — reported for Session C to
produce the utility + placeholder first; wiring is a follow-up once they exist.

### Item 4 (build) — EAS CLI unavailable in sandbox; exact command documented
`npx eas` cannot be installed here (proxy blocks the fetch; `eas whoami` → "could not determine
executable"). No Expo credentials in this environment. **Exact build command (run by maintainer
with Expo auth):**
```
# from repo root, after: npm install --legacy-peer-deps
npx eas-cli@latest build --platform android --profile preview
```
`eas.json` `preview` profile = `channel: preview`, `distribution: internal`, `android.buildType: apk`,
`NPM_CONFIG_LEGACY_PEER_DEPS=true` — matches Decision 027 option A (internal/preview, not store).
No iOS profile is configured in `eas.json`; add an iOS credentials/profile before an iOS build.
User tests the internal build before any store promotion.

### Flagged for build time (unchanged from 027)
- **`runtimeVersion` stays `1.0.0`** in this commit. Bump to `1.1.0` (match `version`) only once the
  APK actually ships, or current 1.0.0 installs get stranded on the preview OTA channel.

## 2026-07-03 — Decision 028: Norwegian Date Display Format (DD.MM.YYYY)
**Status: Complete** — Display-layer date formatting implemented and verified.

### Scope & Constraint
**Display layer only** — `formatDisplayDate(iso: string, lang: 'en' | 'no')` added to `lib/date.ts`. Renders stored YYYY-MM-DD keys as DD.MM.YYYY in Norwegian, keeps ISO format in English. All storage keys, DB values, period comparisons remain YYYY-MM-DD (untouched).

### Display Sites Converted (3 total)
1. **app/budget.tsx** (line 188): Receipt dates in monthly budget list
   - Before: `{r.date}` 
   - After: `{formatDisplayDate(r.date, lang)}`
   
2. **app/shared.tsx** (line 258): Shared task dates in activity log
   - Before: `{item.date}`
   - After: `{formatDisplayDate(item.date, lang)}`
   
3. **app/share-modal.tsx** (line 70): Task dates in QR share selection list
   - Before: `sub: task.date`
   - After: `sub: formatDisplayDate(task.date, lang)`

### Storage Integrity — Verified
- ✅ `todayStr()` — YYYY-MM-DD (DB key, unchanged)
- ✅ `dateStr(d)` — YYYY-MM-DD (canonical, unchanged)
- ✅ `currentMonthStr()` — YYYY-MM period key (unchanged)
- ✅ All date comparisons (`>=`, `<`, `==`) — operate on ISO, unaffected
- ✅ `lastMonthlyReset` setting — ISO key, unchanged
- ✅ Receipt month grouping — based on ISO, unchanged
- ✅ SQLite column values — all remain YYYY-MM-DD
- ✅ Week-range keys — YYYY-MM-DD format, unchanged

### Language Support
- **English**: ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD) — no visual change
- **Norwegian**: DD.MM.YYYY — proper locale convention

Language sourced from `useSettingsStore` at each display site.

### Malformed Input Handling
Returns input unchanged if ISO parse fails (missing segments, empty parts) — never crashes a render.

### File Changes
| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `lib/date.ts` | Added `formatDisplayDate()` function (90–95) |
| `app/budget.tsx` | Import formatter, get lang, apply at line 188 |
| `app/shared.tsx` | Import formatter + settings store, get lang, apply at line 258 |
| `app/share-modal.tsx` | Import formatter, get lang, apply in useMemo at line 70 |

### Verification
- `npx tsc --noEmit` — no date-related errors
- No storage/key logic modified — scope was display layer only
- All display sites correctly receive language parameter from settings store

## 2026-07-03 — Phase 5: Task notifications + reminders coordinator wired (lib/taskNotifications, lib/reminders, lib/time; useTaskStore)

**Status: Complete.** Ported the per-task and weekly/monthly reminder layers
from the sibling `All-the-small-things` repo and wired them into `useTaskStore`.
GATE confirmed first: `lib/habitNotifications.ts` present (2026-07-02 habit
session) — not re-created.

**Pre-existing (verified, not re-ported):**
- `lib/notifications.ts` — already ported in full in the habit session
  (all core helpers: `scheduleDailyReminder`/`cancelDailyReminder`,
  `scheduleTaskNotification`/`cancelTaskNotification`,
  `scheduleWeeklyTaskNotifications`, `scheduleWeeklyReminder`/`scheduleMonthlyReminder`
  + cancels, `pushPastQuietHours`/`isWithinQuietHours`,
  `refreshPersistentNotification`, `syncNotificationCategories`/`onNotificationAction`,
  `scheduleReNudge`). Scope item 1 was already satisfied; left untouched. Signatures
  already match what `useTaskStore` and `lib/habitNotifications.ts` expect.
- The `task_completed` automation trigger in `useTaskStore` (`toggle`/`completeDirect`
  → `useAutomationStore.getState().fireTrigger('task_completed')`) was **already
  wired** (Phase 6, per the store header) — verified, not changed.

**Files ported (verbatim from old app, headers adjusted for rebuild consumer state):**
- `lib/time.ts` — **new** (was missing; `taskNotifications`/`reminders` depend on it).
  `parseTimeStrict` (null on bad input → task reminders cancel) and
  `parseTimeOrDefault` (clamp/fallback 08:00 → weekly/monthly must fire). Pure
  functions, identical to old source; header `Used by →` updated to the two new
  callers.
- `lib/taskNotifications.ts` — **new**. `syncTaskNotification(task, TaskNotifSettings)`
  + `TaskNotifSettings` subset. One-off tasks fire once (skipped if done/past),
  weekly-recurring fire per selected weekday, time-box tasks also get an "end"
  reminder. Quiet hours **SHIFT** the reminder past the window
  (`deferPastQuietHours`/`deferOccurrencePastQuietHours` over
  `pushPastQuietHours`) — deliberately different from the habit side, which SKIPs
  (Decision 016 Q4, unchanged). Byte-identical logic to old source.
- `lib/reminders.ts` — **new**. `syncReminders()` reads the settings store, builds
  localised weekly-planning + monthly-reset Content, schedules/cancels via
  `lib/notifications`. `MONTHLY_OFFSET_MIN = 3` stagger preserved.

**useTaskStore wiring (scope item 4):**
- Added imports: `useSettingsStore`, `cancelTaskNotification` (lib/notifications),
  `syncTaskNotification as scheduleTaskReminder` (lib/taskNotifications).
- Added module-level `syncTaskNotification(task)` → `scheduleTaskReminder(task,
  useSettingsStore.getState())`, matching old app.
- `add()`/`update()` now call `syncTaskNotification`; `remove()`/`clearAll()` now
  `void cancelTaskNotification(id)`; added `syncAllTaskNotifications()` to the store
  type + impl (re-schedules every task after a settings/language change, since copy
  is baked in at schedule time). Header edit-note updated from "not ported / flag"
  to "WIRED".

**Signature divergences from the old app: NONE.** All three ported files and the
store wiring match the old-app signatures exactly (`syncTaskNotification(task, s)`,
`TaskNotifSettings`, `syncReminders()`, `parseTimeStrict`/`parseTimeOrDefault`).
No explicit inversions were needed.

**Left inert (flagged, not this session's scope):** `lib/reminders.ts`'s
consumers — `app/settings.tsx` (does not exist yet), `app/_layout.tsx`,
`app/onboarding/step6.tsx` — currently reference `syncReminders`/
`syncAllTaskNotifications` only in comments/headers as "unported". `syncReminders`
is thus ported ahead of a live caller (same "port the foundation whole ahead of
its consumer" precedent as `lib/notifications.ts`). Those screens must call
`syncReminders()` on startup/finish and `syncAllTaskNotifications()` after
settings changes when they are ported. `lib/notifications.ts`'s persistent-overview
and re-nudge/interactive-action helpers remain unconsumed until their phases.

**Verification:** `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` (exit 0) then `npx tsc --noEmit`
→ 20 errors, all pre-existing old-token-name / `ScreenHeader` `Platform`-import
issues in `app/_scaffold-demo.tsx`, `app/shopping.tsx`, `components/BottomNav.tsx`,
`ScreenBackground.tsx`, `ScreenHeader.tsx`, `ScreenScaffold.tsx`, `Surface.tsx`.

lib/time` → **zero hits**: none of the created/changed files produce errors. (Note:
the native-lib errors from earlier phases — `expo-blur`/`expo-linear-gradient`/
`react-native-svg` — are now resolved since `npm install` brought them in.)
No device run possible here; clean typecheck of the touched files is the bar and is met.

## Branch audit — dead/merged `claude/*` branches (2026-07-03)

Full audit of all 28 `claude/*` branches vs `main`, so future sessions don't re-investigate.
**Only PR #32 (share-modal `formatDisplayDate` routing) carried genuinely-unmerged, wanted code** —
now merged to `main` (`b700fd4`). Everything else is already merged or superseded.

**Remote branch deletion is BLOCKED in the agent environment** (proxy returns 403 on delete
pushes; the GitHub MCP has no delete-branch verb). A maintainer with push rights should prune.

### Safe to delete — fully merged (unique code is byte-identical to `main`, or squash-merged):
catalog-inventory-store-form-xirt9b, daily-spend-budget-indicator-94rx36,
decision-011a-checkbox-nesting-ja2nlb, expanded-permission-native-build-jclj62,
habit-store-form-u5c8ph, home-screen-focus-mode-8ifq6x (code identical to main; only stale log),
initial-planning-files-1sno8w, native-build-setup-k3sj99 (its share-modal commit recovered via PR #32),
norwegian-date-display-2dtqk2, onboarding-screens-port-ebkxe8, phase-3e-icons-pickers-c6d9ps,
phase-4-redesign-sweep-tqrt5m, phase-6-screens-port-12wf2w, phase-6-screens-stores-4qy713,
plans-redesign-taskcard-build-72tk3u, port-habits-meals-health-sgo31x, port-ungated-components-ahvgg2,
s2-decisions-018-019-czw6y5, share-modal-date-routing-merge (the PR #32 branch, now merged),
shopping-item-re-add-increment-m56s1c, shopping-screen-relayout-fz9l44, shopping-store-persistence-ju02hc,
task-hint-note-field-abpt7i, task-store-form-port-ywn750, task-then-link-design-a9jfen,
unfocus-app-dependencies-4mvrjr, unfocus-docs-reconcile-j8yetx, unfocus-edits-workflow-f0ynfv,
weeklistcard-phase-3c-948hqa.

### Review-then-delete (do NOT merge):
- **unfocus-rebuild-queue-u4ax13** — one unique commit (Phase 3c "ShoppingRow redesign, Decision 011
  A2-2"), 61 commits behind main. Its unique code is *older* `ShoppingRow`/`useShoppingStore` versions
  that main has already superseded — **merging would regress main**. Almost certainly dead; kept only
  so a human can confirm the Phase-3c work is truly superseded before deletion.

Prune command (machine with push rights): `git push origin --delete <name> ...` for every branch above.
