# Open decisions — things waiting on the maintainer

**What this file is for.** A question only the maintainer can answer, parked where they will
actually see it, instead of in a paragraph of `AGENTS.md`.

**Why it exists.** On 2026-08-29 the report was *"visual condensing of cards seems like it has
not landed."* It had partly landed. What had not landed was the part that needed a ruling — the
mockup's ~12px rhythm against the app's deliberate 4/8/16/24/32/48 spacing scale — and that
ruling was never requested. It was written down instead, in `AGENTS.md`, as:

> ⚠️ **NOT done in that pass**: `SCREEN_GAP` (16) and `Card`'s padding. The mockup's numbers
> translate to ~12 at this width, which is not a rung on the deliberate … scale … That is a
> design-system decision (add a rung, or don't), **not a defect.**

That note is correct and it was invisible. The maintainer re-reported the symptom two days
later, a session was spent proving the code was on `main` and the OTA had published, and the
answer was in a doc nobody had reason to re-read. **A decision recorded in prose is a decision
that will be re-derived, not made.**

## The rules

1. **Deferring work is fine. Deferring it silently is not.** If a pass stops because it needs a
   ruling, the ruling goes here in the same PR that stops.
2. **State the options with their measured costs**, not "we should decide about spacing". The
   maintainer should be able to answer from this file alone.
3. **Name what it blocks**, so the cost of not answering is visible.
4. **Delete the row when it is answered**, and put the answer where the code lives.
5. A row here is **not** a TODO, a nice-to-have, or a bug. Those go in the code or a PR. This is
   only for *"an agent cannot legitimately choose this."*

_None. The density decision below was answered on 2026-08-29 and is kept as the worked example
of what a row looks like — delete it once a second real row exists._

### Card density: the mockup's 12px against a 6-rung spacing scale
**Asked:** 2026-08-29 · **Answered:** 2026-08-29 · **Blocked:** round 20 phase 1, and every
"the app feels less dense than the mockup" report since.

The mockup (`DESIGN_COMPARISON/20-MEASUREMENTS.md` §1) wants a 12px card gap and 12px of
breathing room against the app's `SCREEN_GAP` 16 and `CHROME_REST_GAP` 8. 12 is not a rung on
the `Spacing` scale, so taking it means widening the scale.

| option | cost |
|---|---|
| Add a 12 rung and use it | The scale goes 6 rungs → 7. Closest to the mockup. |
| Tighten within the scale (16 → 8) | Scale stays pure; a bigger trim than asked for, likely too tight. |
| Leave it | The gap between mockup and app stays, and gets re-reported. |

**Answer: add the 12 rung** — *"12px, but also focus on where and how things are placed as well.
Just decreasing pure space is not the entire thing."*

So the follow-through is not only the gap: the same measured table has the bottom nav at 72
against the mockup's 54, the header at 67 against 60, and `Radius.md` at 16 against 20 — and
round 19's phase 8 (Manage cards generalised beyond Home) is still unbuilt, which is the
"where things are placed" half.
